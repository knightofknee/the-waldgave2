ComponentStructure:

Feed and Profile are the two main pages. Create an Entry is a third screen, it should just be a form though. and it could be a modal on the web. use session storage.

# Feed

- search filter form
- results displayed

# Profile

- Shows all past posts.
- Shows lists of favorite things to recommend to others.
- (not in mvp)Shows journal. to support ideation and knowledge retention, you can save info here. It is basically a minimal blog/wall, you can make a journal entry into a post later. It starts as a private note only you can see, it could become a post in feeds or you could make it visible to others on your wall. You are limited to people coming to your wall and choosing where to look themselves. (I'm not against some sort of RSS feed integration mixed with RSS education, but I also don't want people terminally performing or consuming)

# EntryView

- create an entry is a + sign somewhere,
