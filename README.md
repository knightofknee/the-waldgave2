github makes me mad. It's a great resource and all, but how does a tool used by so many devs suck so hard at basic shit???

for example, I try to push to github locally and it asks for a username and password. AFTER I enter it, it tells me username and password haven't been allowed for years... SO DONT FUCKING ASK. I use github desktop and it just works, it can ask me to verify in my browswer, where I can do whatever I need for security. I type heroku login in the terminal and it does the same.

Github is too damn big, too damn old, and used by too many devs for it to suck so hard. I also wish I could comment on commits here after I make them.
