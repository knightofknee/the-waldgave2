      <p><strong>Privacy Policy — Waldgrave's Bekin application</strong><br/>Last updated: August 18, 2025</p>
<p>The Waldgrave's BeKin platform is a social availability app that lets you light a beacon for friends, view friends' beacons, and post to a friends-only feed. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect</strong>: account information (email, display name/username); your social graph (friends you add, stored as user IDs and display names); content you create (posts, optional links, timestamps) and your beacon status (active/expired and optional message); device data needed to deliver push notifications if you opt in (a device push token); and basic diagnostics and logs to keep the service reliable. We do not collect precise location.</p>
<p><strong>How we use information</strong>: to create and maintain your account; to show beacons and a friends-only feed; to send push notifications you enable (e.g., when a friend lights a beacon); to secure and troubleshoot the service; and to comply with legal obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing and disclosure</strong>: we do not sell your personal information or use it for third-party targeted advertising. We share data only with service providers that help operate the app, including Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, optional Cloud Storage) and Expo (push notifications infrastructure). Content you create is visible to your friends according to app settings.</p>
<p><strong>Data retention</strong>: profile and friends data are retained while your account is active; beacon records are ephemeral and may expire automatically after a short period; posts remain until you delete them or delete your account; diagnostic logs are kept for a limited period for reliability and security.</p>
<p><strong>Your choices and rights</strong>: you can update profile details, remove friends, delete posts, and turn beacons off in the app; you can disable notifications at any time in device settings; you can request deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong>: the app is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will remove it.</p>
<p><strong>International transfers</strong>: we may process and store data on servers operated by our processors in the United States and other regions.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: we use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information; however, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this policy</strong>: we may update this policy as the app evolves. We will post updates at the same URL and change the “Last updated” date above.</p>
