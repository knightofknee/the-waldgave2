    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
    I am running for mayor and I want your support. To be direct, I want to run in order to push the best ideas and logic that I have accumulated. If someone has better ideas, let me know, I want to support and learn from them. I truly believe I have the highest quality and quantity of ideas here. And by here, I mean my direct competition, any Chicago mayor or mayor candidate ever before. I have already cheesed one victory by writing this many different ideas on a public website. If last election's digital platforms are the bar, we've passed. If you believe I am wrong, then I don't want your vote, I want to hear your voice. Send me any better ideas, I want them all please and thank you, much appreciated. I don't want to get caught up on hangups, I want to point in the direction of progress and get us moving. I think I have the best ideas because I have had the privilege to learn many different frames of mind and spend time applying them across different worlds. This city is too broke, this country is too broke, this climate is too fucking broke for us to not accept any and all steps forward. This is the phase where we map out our goals, various destinations to hit. One iconic image is America as the city on a hill, a beacon. It references a bible verse: "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden." We don't have any hills here, I believe Chicago offers a better example because we share common ground level. We've tolerated mediocre government for years because many of us already have enough and don't think we can expect more. You're too nice to be greedy enough. But I'm here to say it's time to get greedy, you deserve everything that you think others deserve. We need to lead by example, not because we deserve it or because we seek it, but because we are in the best position to do better. I don't think I'm always right, I invite you to ignore the 30% of what I say that you dislike the most. In exchange, I ask that you take the other 70% seriously. Can we carve off the global 30% and agree upon a Venn Tesseract, the clear direction to move towards with each step?</p>

    <p> You only need to know two things about my political philosophy, 1) The golden rule is the core of my beliefs and how I think government should function. For any policy, how would you feel if you were any random person affected? The golden rule alone isn't enough, you have to also factor in other people having different preferences than you, and how to live with uncertainty. Buddhism uses the word Equanimity, it is one of the "4 Immeasurables", alongside loving-kindness, compassion and sympathetic joy. To me, equanimity is impartiality, an accurate understanding of what we share. I see deep inequality in our city and world. Which brings us to 2) I want right answers, implemented iteratively and publicly. Math and science have proven their worth, they are the anti-politics tools. And when I look at the history of Chicago, of cars in American cities, when I see the massive productivity gains of technology that enables one person to make beautiful things that can be shared infinitely at no marginal cost, alongside a stagnant minimum wage, I see trash math. I see propoganda as the leader of policy. I am an engineer, a buddhist, I love quantum physics and neuroscience, I understand a bit of how the whole operation functions. AND SOMETHING SMELLS FUNKY. </p>

      Below you will find my Chicago Mayoral platform. These are my main plans loosely described, I want to make sure all important topics are covered. These are not highly edited or very specific yet, maybe even obtuse and silly. I'm currently researching urban design. Please let me know if you have concerns that are not addressed or if you have any particular areas you want to see more of.

    <p>Buddhism has an analog to the scientific method, the 4 Noble Truths. I want to apply this to every city issue, a basic template for progressing logic. You have probably heard something like 'life is suffering', and the Noble Truths are about "suffering", but that's misleading. Why has the West dropped the ball on learning from the Buddha? Until a few years ago, my dad thought the Buddha was fat (and still says it to mess with me). UChicago-educated, when he was growing up in the 60's in Indiana, it was weird to see someone running on the sidewalk, you assumed they were in a hurry. The concept of exercising your heart regularly wasn't common, even though it's so essential. Meditation is the cardio of the brain, in 50 years it will be as common as running if not more, given you can do it anywhere and your brain is pretty important. I say this because I want to be clear about what I mean when I say Buddhism. Meditation is not Buddhism, it is a tool used by Buddhism. Buddhism is a collection of undeniable truths about the nature of our existence as conscious beings.</p>
    <p>4 Noble Truths: What is the current state of the problem? How did it get here? What is the ideal state? What is the path from here to the ideal state? Those are the 4 basic questions any policy change should have to answer. But where does this come from and where did suffering go? Impermanence is the undeniable truth here. Nothing in our universe stays the same, and you can't point to any part of your brain and say that is you. Everything comes into existence and then changes into something else, we often call that dying. As far as we can tell, everything dies eventually, and that inherently introduces the pain of loss. Hence 'life is suffering' is more like . The 4 Noble Truths are a very basic form of problem solving.</p>
    <p>Dream Team. The team of everyone who wants to achieve the same dreams as you. I gotta say, my squad really shows up. I feel so much confidence because I love my dream team. I know my homies love me, and I believe in them. I know I'm not the only one who cries seeing homelessness in 2024. I know I'm not the only one who thinks about the billions of humans that won't ever exist if we continue to pour a single chemical in the air (CO2 + sunlight = higher temperatures. The math is so damn simple, we just ignore it). I know that I'm not the only driver in the city who would bike instead, if I felt safe on our streets. I'm putting together a team. The Chicago Dream Team. Everyone who wants to contribute to a better city is welcome. Civic involvement hasn't really progressed in the digital age since American Idol started the fan vote via texting. We need to make it as easy as possible to participate on the team.</p>
    </>)}
    <h3 id="safety">Safety First</h3>
    <p>Two easy wins here. Cameras on cops, and cameras on streets. I'm an engineer, any good work needs both a good target and good implementation. What I propose here are two systems. The first monitors all active police. Think about this, I just went on Twitch and selected a random game from the front page, "DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO". I scroll down past 100 different live streamers and streamer 101 still had 6 viewers he was actively interacting with. The streamer is not paying Twitch, there was a 30 second ad. We have the infrastructure to let anyone in the world stream for free. Streaming cops doing their jobs should be easy.</p>
    <p>Cop body cams should be an amazing tool for them. Every cop should have support all the time. Experienced cops who can't work in the field anymore can provide live support to other cops. It can even be like a call center, all officers can have their heartrate monitored alongside sound and video. Here are some potential scenarios:</p>
    {/* If they enter a difficult scenario, the police call center could be alerted live, by a button press or from one of these other data points. */}
    <ol>
      <li>
        A gunshot sounds. The microphone on all officers and our new OpenSourceSpotter system installed on our new street camera system all hear within a radius, and they triangulate the source. All nearby officers are instantly connected with a hotline connecting to each other and the call center.
      </li>
      <li>
        An officer's heartrate spikes, the call center is alerted. An experienced officer is immediately connected to the officer in the field, and they can talk through the situation. The call center can also alert other officers in the area, and coordinate with other resources like firefighters, paramedics and mental health professionals. This system ensures that in stressful times, we are truly maximizing our ability to support our officers. No fucking around, we have to use our tools to their max, this is no place for pride or status quo bias.
      </li>
      <li>
        An officer sees something suspicious, he taps a button on his shoulder and he is connected to HQ. Chi-GUI (our LLM, described later) would have a special mode for police that would be based on all files the police has on memory. It could provide some context or answer questions. i-Robot Will Smith would take issue, but it's nothing we can't engineer safeguards around. Updates to how data is used would have to be approved by public vote. And all official uses (as in not private citizens) are recorded in the audit history. Auditors could scan that for abnormalities or specific instances of interest. Have some of the auditors audit the others and you have tied the knot.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This means police officers will monitor themselves, so instead of judging individual cops, auditors will be monitoring the call center itself. They can provide live objections, presented through the police chain of command. Other services could work with the officers based on the call center info. Individual officers shouldn't be allowed to mess up, this system highlights the coaching and puts the responsibility on the superior officers.</p>
    <p>Street cameras, the streets of Chicago aren't private. No one wants to be on camera all the time, but with clearly-written open source software, we can guarantee that all video is only seen by human eyes if it is related to violent crime or if you are objecting to a ticket. The program to punish bad drivers can be extremely forgiving, like basic violations start with a $5 fine that can be waived if you reply to a text saying you will watch your speed or something. We only need to charge enough to change behavior, NOTHING MORE. What if you knew that anywhere in the city, people are driving safely? Isn't that fucking worth something? WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. Technology has given us most of today's world, and we are still massively underutilizing it, especially in government. Vote for an engineer. I'm tired of hearing screeching tires or revving engines at night, and it's basically absent in my neighborhood relative to the ones who have it bad. I will make it stop, if you give me the opportunity. If they don't stop, the punishment goes up.</p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      Childcare is the beginning. We need to support our parents, because they are the most important teachers in their children's lives. Stable households are able to spend more energy on their child each day. Like Minnesota's free lunch for everyone, I want free daycare for everyone in Chicago. Maybe it is only free for low-income families, maybe it is still half the price of current childcare options for everyone else, I haven't run the numbers yet. Here I only have Noble Truth 3#, the ideal, and #4 the direction we can start walking right now to get closer to the ideal. Parents are the #1 resource we have to work with, by volume and by impact on the children. (I think this is a good first step for helping parents, but more education and support is a good avenue to explore further)    </p>
    <p>
      Teachers. I want childcare as a first step to helping teachers. The other contender for most important resource, good teachers. I want to maximize the % of the budget that goes to good teachers. I've heard people say you can't reason with the CTU, those people are playing the wrong game. I want to appeal directly to teachers. I want to reward the best teachers for teaching, I want some of them to focus on teaching other teachers, but ideally still teaching some classes. I want to give new teachers every advantage possible, to ease them in with the help of our best teachers. I also want to remove bad teachers and other obvious wastes of money. This obsession with whether or not we close schools seems like nonsense given I have never heard the stats being discussed. Seems like a classic network analysis problem to me, what is the trade-off betweeen closing or not for each case? THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. We need these types of models made public. If you want to debate something like this, you need to have the data. Public debate can evolve when we put out tools that make it easy for people to use the same data. I want to make arguments a game of finding exactly where people disagree. I want to make public policy discourse about the ideas, not the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since people probably want a direct answer on this, I don't want to get rid of any school model like charter or magnet schools. Maybe they need regulation changes, I have none to focus on now. I do believe neighborhood schools need more support. I think as we get good with public modeling, we start to focus on things like how far is everyone from parks, grocery stores, schools and stuff. This data will really reveal inequalities in the city investment. I believe in the competition that charter schools bring, but we need to be fitting them within OUR long term plans.
    </p>
      <h3>Transportation</h3>
      <p>
    More trains. In rush hour, trains should be coming every 5-10 minutes. The other day I arrived to Merchandise Mart and a packed platform a little after 5 on a weekday, and the next train didn't come for 20 minutes. Taking a train at rush hour should be a pleasant experience, not a stressful packing of people. The number of people commuting is not a surprise, any crowded route should get more trains. God forbid we over-serve the people.
  </p>
      <p>North/South bike-only street</p>
      <p>Smart traffic light overhaul, less pointless waiting</p>
      <p>Camera system from earlier means fewer crazy people driving on the shoulder. And when you see them on the shoulder, you will KNOW that they are either going to the hospital in a hurry, or are helping fund our dear city.</p>
      <p>
      All El signs will ALWAYS show the next incoming trains for each line they are serving. No notices or ads blocking the whole screen. All you need is a color and a number(minutes), there should always be space for them.
      </p>
      <p>
      Concrete-protected bike lane highways north-south and east-west. Track bike crashes and build more protected bike lanes wherever they seem needed. Map out the active cycling population of Chicago so we can get accurate simulations going and can optimize the bike lane making. This is where I need my Industrial Engineering brothers and sisters to step up and make us an open-source model of the city that anyone can interact with through various interfaces. I want to let people propose alterations based on the results of their changes to the model. Let local people find local improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
    Carbon Check- it's like a carbon tax but it isn't a tax because the government gets nothing. We check how much harm people are putting in the air and we charge them. That money goes to a fund, and every month that fund is divided evenly between every citizen. Everyone bears the consequences of these actions, so everyone should be paid to compensate. This can immediately correct incentives. The result? The whole city is incentivized to destory the world less, at ZERO cost. It's just a transfer. This is simply fair, or more accurately, more fair than today. Because we will not be charging the full cost incurred by your gas use. We will be charging a fraction of the cost, and then dividing that fraction evenly. This may seem obvious or too easy, that's because it is the right idea. No more political bullshit, no paying the government. Pure equality. Massive gains with zero infrastructure changes. Do it. Do it now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long-term plan for Lakeshore Drive. Strategic landfilling for the people. We build more land at strategic places to expand Chicago eastward onto land that cannot be built upon. It's an investment that greedy politicians or developers can't spoil. We also reroute LSD westward as the rest of the transit wins allow us to reduce traffic. First LSD can be routed through the Columbus area, eventually down and out of the way like the trains there. The goal is to create a car-free connection between the city and the lake and all it has to offer with the parks as well. Wouldn't it be cool if someone could arrive at Millenium station and walk straight to Millenium park and onto the beach without having to worry about getting hit by a car? Our architecture is even more beautiful when you can safely look up to see it.
  </p>



  <h3>BUBI</h3>
  <p>
    Brains Universal Basic Income. Two Universal Basic Income plans supporting brains, our number 1 resource, hence BUBI.
  </p>
  <p>
    First off, traditional Universal Basic Income, or General for GUBI. If we provide financial stability, we are providing Safety, we are enabling Education, we are giving people the power to choose the direction of their lives. Giving people money is simply the best way to help people in need because they know what they need. That's just a fact we've learned from studies, and developing policy otherwise would be ugly pride with no purpose. So we set up some sort of graduated system so you get less the more you make. One of the variables in that system is how much we contribute. We can set up a structure and start today, there is no minimum amount necessary. The base principle here is the equanimity of brains. GUBI is basically a well-defined bucket we can choose to allocate funds to, or people could donate to. Something you can trust, and seriously reduces the government's ability to mess things up. You know you will be directly supporting other people in your city who have less, and in fair proportion and minimal waste.
  </p>
  <p>
     The top 10% in this country own 67% of the wealth, this middle class junk is just overdone storytelling. What about our most vulnerable brothers and sisters in this city? Everybody can feel safe when everyone IS safe. On your worst day, getting fired from a job or filling out job application #263, what if you knew that at the end of the day you would still have a place to sleep, plumbing, food to eat, and barebones healthcare? Could you live a little lighter knowing that the city had not only your back, but your family and friends' too?
  </p>
  <p>
    The second UBI is more my own creation. It is an employment contract robot essentially. Do you have something you want to do, that will create value for the city? Chi GUI will hear you out and give a fair deal. So I could say, "I want to make phone apps for the city, I want to be paid X. I'll pay you back at rate Y." Chi-GUI (with human help) would decide the expected value of my work, and my ability to earn going forward, and offers new rates. So the variables are the job itself, the salary, and the payment schedule Y. A job that could contribute to everyone's health would help the person's petition, but they could request to do anyting, if the salary and payment schedule aligned with the person's expected income. That payment schedule would be like "if you are making over 50k, for every dollar you make, you will pay the city 5 cents." You can have as many brackets as you want, you could have a higher amount before you start paying back. At first, Chi-GUI is going to be super selective, it only has so much money to invest. It can start ruthless, where it hires good bets that ensure long term doubling return, inflation-adjusted. Each success would fund 2 more eventually. So at first, Chi-GUI is the shrewd investor, but as it grows it can give better deals. It still wants to profit though, because profit can go to the General Universal Basic Income.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can be very selective with who we give money to at the start. I would propose a mix of prioritizing deals that will pay it forward manyfold alongside people wanting to work in professions we need. We could support teachers, nurses, nannies and other caregivers, by investing in their education and long-term health. This could be algorithmic, based on labor stats.
  </p>




 <h3>Other things I care about</h3>
  <p>
    Land tax. No more property tax. Property tax is just so unbelievably stupid. Land is a limited resource, by owning it you prevent everyone else from using it. You should have to pay everyone for your continued exclusive access. Why should you be taxed on the improvements you have made to that land? It's garbage incentives. Switching will be a bit of a pain, but it won't be any worse than the mess that is property taxes today. Land value is easier to calculate, we can ease up on the bullshit. Affordable housing would go up because you would no longer be punished for building bigger on the same patch of land. But you know who will be punished? All those shitty landlords who have been sitting on land, waiting for the value to go up. Zero urgency. They will have to pay for their speculation.
  </p>
  <p>
  Fred Hampton statue, somewhere prominent in the city. A plaque explaining how he was assassinated by the Chicago police, in a planned murder that included the FBI giving the police a detailed floor plan indicating where Fred Hampton slept. He was the potentially the best leader we have had, and the city has let his memory go improperly marked. Despite having murdered the man, the police abuse of Fred Hampton didn't stop there, the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago helped block the renaming of a street after him. Not some bold change like renaming lakeshore drive, just one of the brown signs under the regular street signs. We have over a thousand of them, most go unchallenged, and most are not as deserving. They murdered him and his legacy, to let this injustice stand robs the city of a role model as well.
  </p>
  <p>
  Reveal the stars of Chicago. Make the sky beautiful. Reduce light pollution from street lights by changing the design and updating the tech. Light going up into the sky doesn't help anyone, it can be as simple as covers. **insert guess here** # of stars that would be revealed as the fog is lifted. I know some changes would cut it in half, but what is possible might be much better. Also, the city will highlight a chicago star citizen or cluster of citizens each day alongside a stars gained count. A daily open mic of sorts. That plus a safety net of UBI, healthcare and housing guaranteed, we could transform the starving artist, relieve some of the stress that is actively taking years off the lives of the lower class.
  </p>
  <p>
  Force Bears to stay and build a bigger stadium in the same area, give them any land they need and let them pay for and own the stadium. For however much the city gives up in the deal, the city gains part ownership of the Bears. So for every dollar in profit the Bears take home, the city would get a percentage. We can get some Chicago accounting firms to make independent guesses on the fair value of the deal. As a bonus, I want to see a player alumni ownership group. The team could really use some check on shitty ownership decisions, VIRGINIA!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll get us out of the parking deal theft. It was an illegal sale, I have a rant down below, just search for Redoma Sarl. I'm gonna venture a guess you haven't searched that name before, but that is THE PRIMARY OWNER OF OUR PARKING. 50.1%. You probably know Morgan Stanley and Abu Dhabi own the rest, 49.9%. Those important names decided to give a controlling interest of their money to this company no one knows anything about, including chatGPT. How fucked is it that you haven't heard this name before? I love to make up conspiracy theories, so I start feeling looney when I see things this batshit insane. Why did they give this mysterious company controlling power? Best case scenario, if you believe this sketchy nonsense: someone on reddit gave me a url linking directly to a pdf, on page 18 in a single column, it had the name Redoma Sarl. This, the shadiest interaction I've had on the internet, indicates they are owned by Allianz, a company on the German stock exchange. So best-case scenario, half our money is directly transferred to European stockowners.
  </p>
  <p>Chi GUI will hear all. Chicago LLM helps fascilitate everything it can for the city. At first it is a General User Interface for 3-1-1 and other bureaucratic endpoints. It could publish questions like an FAQ maintained live. You could ensure that people are heard and questions answered, or at least you'd have perfect stats on it. Any user that is registered with an ID or something proving they are Chicagoan could opt into shaping the bot anonymously by letting their words influence things like Chi GUI's vocabulary and accent.</p>
  <p>
    I want to save Kanye. "This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up, For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times, You can never go too far when you can't come back home again." Kanye West does not particularly deserve to be saved. But we are all family, everyone deserves a home to come back to. If Kanye stays lost, that's because we haven't shown him the way home. Imagine what Universal Basic Income could have meant for a young Kanye. Instead of the fear of being homeless, he could have focused on his career. He would have never needed to leave Chicago to begin with. If we could teach Kanye how to take care of his mental health, he would pass that on to many people. Keep in mind though, we aren't making a Kanye pitch, we are advocating for mental health. Getting through to Kanye is just a test of our messaging.
  </p>

 <h3>Process changes</h3>
  <p>Ranked Choice voting. For everything, Mayor and School Board seem like an obvious start. Ideally, all elections have equal spending between candidates. I for one hate ads. Filth being thrown into our minds without consent. Your brain doesn't have defenses like a computer, you're continuously vulnerable to your context. The forefront of the modern science of the mind has been consistently been weaponized against other people for the sake of money. Ads are AIDS, literal brain AIDS. They use your brain's natural defenses to further their goals. I don't want to campaign on ads, I want to campaign on a broad coalition of people who want to accomplish the same goals. Hence the conspiracy. So please let me know what you think, or share this with someone who may be interested.</p>
  <p>
    Too many things have been decided by greed or chaos, we need to demand engineering-based answers. We need to track what works and iteratively improve. Everything possible should be open source. We can mathematically prove that we are making the right decisions with an open process. Any popular competing idea can get its fair shot at proving itself. It's a way of fighting back against corruption by removing the human element at key junctures. It's also a way to combat past injustices, like how the auto industry stole American streets through propoganda and (lobbying)bribes. Use of public space is a pet peeve of mine. I want engineers optimizing how we can best share the space, not some bullshit status quo established by the most manipulative people of their time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will not seek re-election. I would much rather foster the growth of others and shine the light on their work. After 4 years of that, hopefully you guys get some good option to choose from (with ranked choice of course). If not, then I failed and don't deserve another term anyways. I only feel comfortable demanding the throne because I have put in many years of thought and I truly believe that these ideas will have a massive impact if I get the green light. I don't want fame or power, I'd rather not be recognized on the street. I don't think it's going to be a problem eventually, because once I cover up the light pollution and cut out the bullshit, you guys will be amazed by all of the stars that have been hiding.

    {/* I am an engineer with no desire to be famous. I'd much rather work on my website and apps and remain anonymous, but I can't. Our world is too fucked, our city government is too fucked.

    <h2>My Qualifications</h2>
    {/* <p>For now, you can call me Young Carl, because I am my <a href="https://youtu.be/Gllwc13H6qY?si=CGlvN62t6be63bX4">authentic self</a>. I don't have anything else to present as because I don't give a shit about things that don't matter. This is awkward for being a public figure but too bad. I wouldn't be here if I thought someone else had a quarter of my ideas already. I've been studying Buddhism for a few years, it is like the computer science of consciousness. My personal plan as a public personality is to destroy the ego of the west. But here is how I see myself: I've always wanted to understand how things worked, initially I wanted to be an architect. Then I wanted to build things with math. Math started to get less applicable so I focused on engineering. Industrial engineering is the study of mathematically modeling anything, I love it but I found the biggest barrier to industrial engineering was that people in power just don't care, my role is promoting industrial engineers. Economics was fun but similarly, no job let me tinker with an economy. I love software engineering because I can build things from scratch, understanding each part, while also setting the overall goal. Now I am studying neuroscience, because the brain is basically the peak of curiosity and computing. I understand how things work. At the most basic level, and in the big picture. In my mind, those are the only 2 things in government you really need, long term vision paired with only solid steps forward. I'm also learning jazz piano and I dance regularly, with long-term rap dreams. I'm a fan of improvisation and people with more style than me. I want to be both an enabler and gatekeeper. Government shouldn't suck, it should only get better. We have the math.</p> */}

            <p> I believe in myself because I believe in people and I think I'm people too. Everything that I think is truly important about me can be learned by anyone else. I want to run solely on my ideas, but I'm happy to share my methods. I am working on a book/horde of information for my neice and nephew for when they are older called the Basic B's of Being, so this has been on my mind for a few years. Here's my basic current system, it is based on the concept that your last 18 months of actions determine the habits that are your default. Those actions require less effort, and so if you do something you want to do nearly every day for 18 months, it is actually harder for you to NOT do the desired actions. I decided to make a 3 18-month plan, the 54 month plan. In the first 18 months, you decide on one or a few things you want to be doing regularly. Then devise the minimum way you could do the thing. The most important aspect is the consistency, 5 minutes a day of something is easy to fit in. Don't be discouraged by the lower volume, you are building up a grand snowball. You reprogram your own electric forest through associations. The second 18 months are focused on taking each of your core activities to the next level, whatever that means to you. I'm halfway through this phase. Phase 3 is to lock in the ideal habits that were learned in phase 2. So right now, I'm trying to settle into my ideal routines. It's not about forcing anything, it is simply answering this question: when you do have free time, how do you want to be spending it? Take the 4 Noble truths to that. What do you do now, and why? What do you want to be doing, and what's standing between you and doing that? What does doing that thing for 1 minute a day look like? 5-10 minutes? Do whatever you need to do to make the important things daily, key off of existing routines like waking up and meals. Your basic routine can always be extended into more of that work, but rejoice in the success of daily intention. You're walking through your Electric Forest every day, each trip down the same path wears it in a little bit more. Accept the noble duty of Waldgrave of your own mind, it is already yours. The internet/social media is a sort of Electric Jungle, as full of life and variety as the Amazon. I think a role I can help serve is cutting through the bullshit to show you towards the best paths and to correct misinformation. Other than that, I'm not seeking fame or fortune, I want to help people who know better than me fix things I know are broken. I stopped wanting to be an industrial engineer not because I didn't believe in mathematically modeling the world, but because I could see that the major hurdle was getting people to listen to industrial engineers. </p>
            <p>My things: walking, meditation, reading, yoga, exercise, creative writing, music, working on the Waldgrave. These are the things I'm choosing to invest in.   </p> */}

Taxation without Representation, DAY 1 SHIT FFS! If my taxes don't go to where my representatives say, THAT IS TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. Of course, we might need to make longer term deals for infrastructure or energy as needed, but this was a pure transfer of wealth, from us and our children and their children, to a corrupt governer famous for his corrupt father and the corrupt city council he led.(btw, the investors have already made their money back, with 60 years to go. We aren't defaulting, we are asserting our basic rights and letting the thieves off the hook with a better-than-market return. And you are worried they will cry? I say we offer a Chicago law school student competition to represent the city in any impending lawsuits. The City does not have to spend a dime, we appeal up to the Supreme Court, and accept their decision. Anyone who wants to help the case for free can support the winning students).

Parking meter pricing should be a supply and demand-based system to maximize utilization of limited space. THAT is the real goal, so it should be the goal variable. If there is plenty of parking available in an area, then the price should be low to none. As availability goes down, the price can rise to the max. It looks like Chicago still sets pricing, yet it went up?? Why is our government fucking us so hard on this? Change the pricing model immediately, and stop paying Abu Dhabi + Redoma SARL, who share the company that is the largest owner of our parking in a 49.9/50.1 split. You know Abu Dhabi, but why does 'Redoma SARL' have a controlling interest over the city of Chicao's streets? I google 'chicago tribune Redoma SARL', nothing. Not one webpage with the name of the biggest owner of our street parking, who we are sending hundreds of millions of dollars to every year? I think a few of those dollars stay here in the wrong pockets. And elsewhere, because I don't see any other identification of Redoma SARL online. Like the Epstein of Chicago, do people really not care or are the capable people afraid? I threw this conspiracy around a little in the Chicago subreddit, and someone sent me a link saying that Allianz, a european company. They wouldn't say where they got the information from, but it was a link to a 60 page pdf that on page 19 just said Redoma SARL on one line item. Some Jason Bourne shit.

{/* Here's the fat, easy win. We stop paying them, serving two main purposes. 1- We the people of today are the only ones with the right to act and decide today. We will challenge the legality of the previous sellout deal. 2- Redoma SARL and friends will have to show themselves. I will not tolerate Chicago money going to terrorists, Russia and North Korea. I can't prove that it is, but that cannot be the burden of proof here. You have to prove that you aren't knowingly doing business with terrorists, stuffing your head in the sand is no excuse. */}

    Carbon Check- it's like a carbon tax but it isn't a tax because the government gets nothing. We check how much harm people are putting in the air and we charge them.

This can immediately correct incentives.

    Security Update 1: Street Safety, Oversight, and Enhanced support

    I want to put cameras on every Chicago street (at the same time we could upgrade our street lamps and see more stars at night, they don't need to point up). They should hopefully be discreet. The deal is that these cameras will only be used when dealing with violent crime + theft. The data usage is on open source code, and auditors can see who accessed what. Any access is logged.

    Alongside this, I want all officers to have their cameras and microphones on at all times. This data will hit a general ai that we train, so based on what it hears and sees, alongside heart rate and such, can give the police whatever they need to best support their officers. Screams and gunfire would trigger a raising of the alert level for the officer. The officer can raise the alert level themselves whenever they want. For any elevated scenario, they are put into contact with the police support center. From there, experienced officers can give critical advice to officers all over the city. Also though, two other groups are watching: the auditors and other support teams. Firefighters and mental health workers can respond in live time and communicate with the police support team. The job of police officer is hard, we should give them the best support we can. And this gives us live oversight, and a system for improvement.

    BUBI- Brains' Univeral Basic Income

    My goal is a general ubi but here is a potential path there: offer some varying yearly amount (varying based on the terms they make) to software developers to work on any open source project that benefits Chicago. They would pay back over time when their income is sufficiently high, based on a payscale they agree to. So some people might stay low income, but the majority could return several times that. Once that income starts coming in, the program could expand to other groups, artists and teachers come to mind. What deal could we offer that works? I'd want something like until you return 10 (7?) times what you take, except the pay scale would mean it wouldn't matter to you ever. In short, to start UBI, all you need is capital to expect a good return on the best group you can identify. I have no idea who is best, I just know software develops have a high salary, and many new devs are looking for some experience before they find their first job. I want to make effectively guaranteed deals so that we can get initial funding (investors get a guaranteed return but then they are out), and so that they can contribute to the expansion of BUBI.

    Land Tax. No more property tax. Property tax is just so unbelievably stupid. Land is a limited resource, by owning it you prevent everyone else from using it. You should have to pay everyone for your continued exclusive access.

    Why should you be taxed on the improvements you have made to that land? It's garbage incentives. Switching will be a bit of a pain, but it won't be any worse than the mess that is property taxes today. Land value is easier to calculate, we can ease up on the bullshit.

  {/* <!-- <h2>Chicago priorities (redundant now)</h2>
  <p>
    First is security. I propose that we do all we can to make our city safe, while protecting our privacy and civil rights through clear processes with audit trails. I want cameras on every city street, with the footage only being accessible for violent crimes and all searches are recorded. Everything goes through general machine learning, but any viewing of footage has to be sanctioned. Any additional use of the cameras beyond violent crime would require a city vote. My other security element is universal basic income. We can set up a UBI program with what we have, limited in count or amount or both, and set it up so that if you later have an income above x% of the poverty line, y% of your additional income goes to the UBI fund. The tax drastically lowers when the UBI fund is growing (it keeps growing so that one day it won't need the tax). Alongside the street cameras, I want all cop cameras linked live whenever they are active. This footage will be fed to the police and other help teams. The footage will be fed into machine learning and any escalated scenarios will be highlighted. For every cop, there is a live support line. They hit a button or say the right thing, they can raise their status themselves as well. They are then connected to the best available support staff who see and hear the situation live. This goes beyond accountability, failure is failure. This establishes clear perfomance: the officers do their job normally following basic procedure with cameras on at all times, and then in escalated scenarios the responsibility falls first on the police support team giving orders based on all information at hand. The rest of the responsibility falls on the watchers. This group oversees and audits the cam footage alongside the supporting communication of the police. They hear and see everything because they are part of the same general support team. The goal of this setup is to reduce the obvious risk of individual police officers being unprepared for escalated situations by prioritizing supporting them by using tech to bring the experience of the veteran officers to the ear of every officer. Hard decisions are made, and this will give a space for criticizing choices as they are being made. Alternatives from other groups like mental health support can be brought in quickly. We ask officers to do too much with too little support. This would make new officers' lives much better while providing accountability, and we need a lot of new officers now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second is education, the 2 priorities I see are providing the best possible support for new teachers, and having the best teachers teach the other teachers (they can still teach students directly or not). But I think the ROI of helping our teachers is immense. For every level and every class in the CPS, we should have all possible materials prepared for new teachers. New teachers should be given every advantage and should have experienced teachers alongside them. I want Chicago to be the top destination for new teachers. And with the UBI plan, I want to enable anyone of any income or age to become a student again if they want.

    Third is transportation. Immediately we need to hire more drivers for the CTA, there is no 'driver shortage', they just aren't willing to pay enough. The value is there though, just one driver provides so much potential value. No more ads on train info signs, a number and a color tells you how many minutes until the next train for that color's line. Yet they block out the whole sign for fucking ads. The paper schedule doesn't have that shit. I want some north/south and east/west streets converted to just bike lanes, while others then say or recommend no bikes in the street. I want new trains, high speed rail to O'hare and Midway. These programs could be funded in a structure where the investors are initially involved, but they have a cap, so they could charge whatever they want, but after making enough money, they would no longer be involved. It's like a loan, except the payments are linked to the success of the train. Profits from these lines will then turn towards funding other lines. This should work, because we are guaranteeing inflation adjusted return on investment, eventually. When is that? That's the only risk investors will be taking on. It's like ownership of profits until you have been sufficiently paid for your investment. We can use private enterprise, on public terms. */}

    Force Bears to stay and build a bigger stadium in the same area, give them any land they need and let them pay for and own the stadium. For however much the city gives up in the deal, the city gains part ownership of the Bears. So for every dollar in profit the Bears take home, the city would get a percentage. If they leave, get the Jaguars here, the McCaskeys could clearly use some competition. The Bears go backwards and match the Cubs on the north side, the Jags join the Socks as the real team of the city (sorry I'm not sorry, they decided to stop competing, that isn't very Chicago of them).

    Fred Hampton statue, somewhere prominent in the city. A plaque explaining how he was assassinated by the Chicago police, in a planned murder that included the FBI giving the police a detailed floor plan indicating where Fred Hampton slept. He was the potentially the best leader we have had, and the city has let his memory go improperly marked. Despite having murdered the man, the police abuse of Fred Hampton didn't stop there, the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago helped block the renaming of a street after him. Not some bold change like renaming lakeshore drive, just one of the brown signs under the regular street signs. We have over a thousand of them, most go unchallenged, and most are not as deserving. They murdered him and his legacy, to let this injustice stand robs the city of a role model as well. Is there anything worse in this city's history that I should know of?

  {/* <p>
    Violence in the city: the new police oversight system paired with the increased budget we need to hire and keep a competent police force will give us some basic tools we need. The real wins will come from building up. The education system needs an overhaul, new teachers need a support system to help them flourish where they are now suffering. Singapore has many best practices to learn from. New teachers should be taught by successful teachers who now focus on teaching teachers. Another big win comes in the form of Universal Basic Income, establishing a minimum income floor for all residents. I want all residents of Chicago to have access to a roof and a floor. This should provide means and hope to the kids out there currently mired by all this violence. This can start small, and as the budget gets balanced and we can afford it, it will rise. Imagine if a family member of yours found themselves homeless, or infirmed and in medical debt? I'd feel much better if I knew they had the simple bear necessities. Chicago is my family, I believe that together we can support our most vulnerable.

  {/* <h3>Long term plan for Chicago and Illinois</h3>
  <p>
    Universal basic income will not only support our most vulnerable neighbors, it will enable many people to take time to not only find a better job, but to pursue their own passions, whatever they may be. It sets a financial goal we want to reach, where the government financial holes are finally cauterized, and we start to get a tax surplus. Once we get a surplus, we shouldn't be taxing as much because the bill is paid. When we reach that point, additional income should be rewarded with a lower income tax that goes into the BE FUNd. The BE fund is set aside to grow until the gains in the BE fund are enough to fund the government, state and city taxes gone. The BE fund wants to give everyone the gift to be whoever they want to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reach this lofty goal, the BE Fund starts small and grows alongside our ability to fund it. We want to tax the 1% to get this done, but we should provide incentive for them to stay, to come here. The pension problem should be understood as the government promising money that they didn't have, instead of just paying people. If you want to help someone for their future retirement in particular, buy an annuity for them. We need to stop the losses and put ourselves on a path of recovery. The UBI would start small in disadvantaged neighborhoods and then expand. After an agreed upon UBI level is reached, and other projects are funded, then taxes should be progressively decreased on everyone. It is important to note that the Universal Income Floor would be slowly built up.
  </p> */}
    {/* <p>The initial 'Open Chicago' idea is that we have a coding competition, any open source project that benefits the city in any way. Ideally, there is a prize and the top project is also sanctioned by the city. No matter what the city does, I will promote it. We should make it easy for people to make free contributions to their city. The whole premise of open source should be perfect for the city of Chicago. It's free labor (the city is broke), the change process is transparent (the city is corrupt/incompetent, take your pick), but the people of the city are great (and we want to empower them).</p> */}
    {/* <p>
      A later goal would be to make a leaderboard for contributions to the city, could have a line count board, and another board based on some sort of review tool that takes out line count inflation.

    {/* <p>
      A later, later goal is to take the github/open source approach to other parts of the functioning of the city. Every part of how the city works can be put there. Each step like it is a software function. Then people can post their complaints about how a particular process is broken, and they can even post solutions then. Those solutions are reviewed by the community on the same platforms like github, in the same way. As it develops, you can add rules for when the city must accept the change or respond with their disagreement.
    </p> */}
    {/* <p>
      Another project I want to build is called the More Perfect Platform. It will be a tool for me to present my own political platform, but more importantly, I want to make it for others to use as well. The idea can be summed up as a subreddit mixed with github with a more complicated comment system. It should make it easy for people to compare platforms side-by-side on specific topics. I'd also want to give the candidates a place to debate in long-form, so it's not the live bullshit of tv debates but still has a strong moderator in two forms, the first is the different logic fields that are required, like "what is the top opposition view to your current view"? (if they have a named opponent, that opponent gets a spot to post their view on the issue (character restricted (1000?) with link to more)). The other moderator is the general public upvoting, downvoting and commenting. Users get a score based on their response rate to questions with sufficient upvotes. The responses are also scored based on general user feedback. Instead of the normal up/down vote for those, the buttons are "answered the question clearly", "avoided the question", and "gave a partial answer". The main goal here is to lay out views clearly and enable direct democracy as best we can with the tools at hand. You will be able to use a drivers license to verify that you are a resident of the city or state, and your vote will go towards the score that shows first, the verified Resident voters. For active politicans, this should be the most useful aspect. We will have residents filtering the requests and opinions of residents, the non-tech equivalent is hard to imagine, a mob of millions of people sorting the opinions of millions simultaneously. Direct democracy has never been more feasible, it's about time we started developing appropriate tools in earnest. 'Who wants to be a Millionaire?' and their ask the audience button, or a reality tv show vote is all I've seen so far.
