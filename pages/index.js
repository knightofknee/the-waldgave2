      <h2>Wacky Wednesday FAQ</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>Why is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>Open creativity needs you to create an open space for it. And it is a fun way to hang out with friends and talk. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>How is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>Through creativity, weird and effort. Creativity comes easy when you put in the Effort to set up an environment where you can comfortably be Weird</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Who is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>You, or You and your friends, or You and some potential new friends</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What is a Wacky Wednesday</h4>
        <p>It is an event in which you and any number of friends gather together for some creativity and socializing. I recommend some open art and/or music time as a base, ideally with a creative event of any sort. The event can be whatever, some past examples include an improv excercises, painting, song writing and karaoke. Anything that involves creativity or learning works. Besides that, the only other major element is creating a space where everyone involved feels as comfortable as possible to create and share with no judgement. Improv group exercises can be a great first or second Wacky Wednesday to help the group get in the "yes and..." mindset. Process over product, the goal is to give everyone space to explore.</p>

            Originally used to refer to an officer having jurisdiction over a royal forest during the times of the Holy Roman Empire. You need to be the Waldgrave of your own electric forest. Understand the nature of your brain and navigate accordingly. Impermanence, nonself, dependent origination. These are base realities of our forest. If you learn how to navigate your forest effectively, it will forever flourish.

            The Waldgrave social media is a safe meeting place for people to share their paths through the Vast Thought Forest. A place to share both cool places you have found in the Forest, and share the path that you walked as well. And only walking is allowed on the Waldgrave social media. No more than 2 posts in a week. Equal opportunity social media, fully in your control. No pushing other content on you, private by default. You can do whatever in your own neck of the woods with your profile, list your favorite things, journal, or endlessly shitpost, it is your space. But none of that will be seen unless someone visits your page or you use one of your 2 weekly posts to highlight your latest gems.

            The area in your brain where the different forms of consciousness meet, the forest of paths. Your understanding how to manage your own waldgrave determines which part of your self tends to get expressed. You wander your own forest, be a kind and prudent officer. Modern science fiction loves to get all dark and say that suffering is the only way to create consciousness. But the core concept is simple: you need to reject your base programming in order to learn how to edit and influence your own programming. Pain and anger can make you do something you regret, and you become more self reflective about your actions. Here at the Waldgrave, we believe in two superior alternatives 1) Love, Jesus+Buddha and others have hammered home the benefits, and it is the sort of ideology that can be used as a filter for looking at the world in a new light. The dual perspective shows the conscious experience as a path towards "god" as a state of mind, or deeply ingrained and incorporated knowledge that continually shows off its benefits. And 2) Weird, the Weirdforce is always an option. Just like the weak force, you can be seemingly stuck in a tight relationship with something or someone. At any moment, you could leave that dimension entirely and never return. You are a vast cloud of potential, while simultaneously always existing within your body at one thought+feeling at a time. You always have at least 3 options: continue what you are doing, stop, or do something, anything different. Meditators use gongs as check-ins for if you are lost in thought. If you gave a consciousness a timer, short term memory and long term memory and rules around how the exchanges work, and then kept forcing it to do something new, aka something weird, then that would be enough to spawn some new form of consciousness. Ideally, we combine the Weird with the Love.

            The Waldgrave stands for giving all brains the ability to thrive. We want to provide tools for free or at cost. We want to learn as much as we can and then to share the best of what we find. We want to enable individuals to pursue whatever they think they can do that will most benefit humanity. To help others help themselves and others however we can.

            The Waldgrave will never make a product worse or charge for something we could provide for free. The enshitification of tech is a terrible crime that will inevitably be fixed by the natural equilibrium of a product that can be shared with everyone after completion for free. Open source tech is one obvious answer, but even if that isn't the answer, companies will eventually compete to a Nash equilibrium like the price of an index fund or 1080p flatscreens. The question is how long will you let these vampires feed on you?

            Your mind has no center subject running everything. Instead your mind is this vast forest of thought plants sprung up from many seeds. You travel through this interconnected forest. To live a better life, you should be a steward or waldgrave to your own thought forest. Wherever you go, you should make it better by enforcing the laws of your land, by cleaning it up or tying up loose ends. Unsolved problems linger, let those be the ones that thrive.

        <h4>What is Good?</h4>

          Everything is Good, stop stressing the shoulds and worrying the woulds, can the coulds, everything is good.

        <p>A positive attitude isn't just wishful thinking, it is a superior operating system for your brain. Fight or flight emotions prepare you for a battle we rarely ever fight anymore. You only have so much brain capacity, get over yourself. Staying mad about something is self harm, but caring about something can be empowering. Being outwardly thankful and positive also helps other people stop guessing what you are thinking, they can relax their brain and exit anxiety-mode as well. (the <a href='https://youtu.be/MtimAuhyP-M?si=dcA1Vs7-HLsxlk66'>first half of this video</a> explains it well in biological terms.)</p>
        <p>
          Our brains are inherently a product of the past, shaped by a mix of your inner thoughts, outer stimuli and how you reacted to them, along with much chaos. You are the active processes in the brain. You didn't create it, but you travel within it and choose which paths to take. Your actions further shape it for your future self. Habits form grooves, much wider paths. As you bounce around your brain, it is hard to avoid your natural habits, they are the easier paths. You have to work harder to do something new. This is something to both weaponize and fight against, as you shape your habits to better serve you, and to create a better brain to live in. Be the protector of your own forest, the waldgrave of your own brain.

        {/* <p>(newer thoughts). Everything is language, perception is language, consciousness is a conversation of the different stimuli coming to you brain, a discussion between the outside and inside perceptions. A human raised away from any other humans suffers more than other species. Language lets us communicate with others, but it also lets us communicate better with ourselves. We needed logic to be able to share language. Logic lets you explore The Forest. The Forest of All Possible Thought. If you take a short path and then come back out, you can talk to others and map out that new path. You can give anyone instructions and they will be able to come to the same path. If you go wandering too deep into the forest, you can find your way back, but you won't be able to guide anyone there, and you can only describe what you saw there.</p> */}
        {/* <p>
          The more you get used to exploring the forest, the deeper you can go, as you find the natural landmarks and geography of the forest. Maybe it is a stream, or a clearing with a hill and a fruit tree. These natural thought formations are clear to all, and serve well for sharing your mappings with others.

          On the cosmic level, we are insignificant and might not even have free will, so why should we spend so much time with judgements? I think the universe is a good thing, and we are a part of it. We are basically patterns, we can lean into the rest of the universe or pull back, and we can choose to observe more or less. We can learn from those interactions, but I don't see the need to judge a part of the universe for being how it is, even if that part is part of me. This brings us to the individual level. People exist on top of a collection of waves, constantly riding ups and downs. But we only observe people at one point at a time. This creates a perception issue, especially for people you don't know. Living in a city, the effect is heightened. If you are around a lot of people, it is expected that you will pass by people at the bottom or top of their waves regularly. If a good driver makes a small mistake once every 100 trips, but you are driving past 400 cars a day, expect to see at least 4 small mistakes. Everyone is driving a different spaceship through the same spacetime, yours accelerates at a different speed than mine, so it may seem like I am intentionally going slow when in reality I am going full speed. Or my ship has had several flat tires thanks to the potholes in my neighborhood, so I'm a little more anxious driving around them than you. Everyone has ups and downs because that's the very nature of our universe, matter and existence is based on ripples. To promote existence as we know it, we want to push up the wavefunctions of others. To do that, we need to understand their waves, their magnitude, frequency, and where they are at right now. Getting in-sync is more important than it may initially seem, in our universe if you have two waves of equal magnitude and frequency destructively interfering (hitting each other when one is high and the other is low), they cancel each other out and both waves disappear. So if you are able to get on the same page as someone, you can boost their upswings and help temper their downswings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, you are a biological computer that is constantly re-programming itself based on neural paths taken. We have limited processing power that we manage, 'we' are not the full brain, we are a part at the top front that connects to the rest, and seems to make decisions. How we think actively shapes our brains, the repeated surges through neurons are like the strings vibrating to create the base waves of our universe. 86 billion little splashes shape the seas of your mind. Meditation has you focus on a background wave that is always there, the in and out flow of your breath. As a new thought rises out of an inner wave peaking, you acknowledge it, understand where it came from, and let it go. You find its amplitude and frequency, get in sync with it, and hug it away with some deconstructive acceptance. You accept that your brain is a product of the past so this thought is a reaction you cannot control. What you can control is your reaction to your brain's default reaction, and in meditation your reaction is to focus back on your breath. But outside of meditation, this enables you to react to your immediate reactions and evaluate the output of your brain, which in turn shapes your brain for the next time. This is where I think conscousness and free will live. Through this, I believe meditation enables you to be more intentionally you.
