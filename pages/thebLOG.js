  A little late at night so speed mode. Here are some notes, with somes notes on top of that.

“I like the idea that all advanced civilizations disappear into the micro world. They find simulations to be a pathway towards immortality and exploration. There is a bit of a time race and then it gets to a point where to exit a simulation level is to leave it for millennia, if you ever do return. So there are “real” people and then there is this massive pool of the would-be dead inside these simulations. The real people have an inherent information advantage, but they lose that quickly as the simulators have years to study for what is days on the outside. The reals anticipate this and put the simulators on guard, wanting to be safe of anyone trying to come out, as unlikely as that may seem.”
</p>
<p>
I like this concept a lot because it gives a good reason for why we don't see advanced civilizations. They are so small that they don't show up on our telescopes, and most of the population is in the sims. It also means that we could be invaded easily by such a civilization, as they would react to us using their time and size advantage to get in unnoticed.

“Carl decides not to rush time travel. He learns from an early visitor when he had his original breakthrough. To keep continuity, Carl decides to not invent it again before the same time. He ignores time travelers and pretends they are crazy“    - Electric Forest-centered time traveler. He keeps coming back to certain places, but because he keeps his cool and sticks to his plan, he doesn't disrupt the timeline. He is super careful. Once he finally does discover time travel though, at the proper time, he has a lot of dope plans. Post-invention Carl doesn't hold back though, he is all over the place and completely unpredictable. So many, many times different Carls past come along to try to subtly give advice, wallow in their own misery, or to battle other time travelers. OG Carl is unfazed, he may be the youngest but he has the latest and best advice to draw from. The character development ends up focusing on the different future’s past Carls and their philosophical differences.

“Space themed show like star trek but it exists at the cellular level. They are the People's Navy, they sail only inside of people mainly. There is much risk turning large again so a race of little people is born.
</p>

Our character is new to the mini mission and thinks he will be transformed back. No one told him the odds of surviving were 1/10 and the odds of not having debilitating pain were 0/768 trials so far on record. So when he is captured, he willingly adapts and learns the new life.

MC brings promise of a "cure", a new revival technique his boss was working on. He believed the lies because he thought the corporation would be way ahead of them, not decades behind. MC teaches the concepts to the little people and their tech army finishes the job. The little people gain the ability to transform at will and they have invaded every politically or militarily significant person, maybe even every person. Tracking them is difficult, no one has ever scanned negative, or would if they could make such a scan. The little people seize power instantly, a globally televised event via hacking the visual cortexes of the world. Most of the globe capitulates in the first 30 seconds, we ask if anyone wants to test us, please ask how so that we may limit violent waste. They have the eyes of every key target, anyone who reaches for the proverbial gun explodes into thousands of pieces, destroyed from within. Hesitation is permitted, the rest are engaged in personal debate by the people living inside of them. the operators who have seen everything, more than the people themselves.
</p>
<p>
MC is disillusioned so they give the tech to the other side. This let's them kill and extract the little people inside them. It's like murdering a planet each time in terms of sentient lives lost.
</p>
<p>
MC sees that they are worse and goes back to the little people. They get ahold of the global mini network and learn how to transport people out. They evacuate whole people who are then murdered for the cause.“

scientology fan fiction (basically my psychological thriller but with Shelly as MC)
</p>
<p>
Shelly finds a secret left by Hubbard and escapes down the rabbit hole of this sci fi discovery. I gotta read a scientology summary and make up her story based on that. Like mix in Hubbard's wacky aliens with brainwaves and neural patterns. The idea that if the brain is a computer, someone else could write code in your brain and you would ride those thought paths. But how you react to them is still yours and yours alone. The active thought process is still a complex operation using so many parts together.
</p>
<p>
Shelly achieves what L. Ron only discovered in theory, she programs an alien pattern into her brain and begins to gain an enhanced consciousness which proceeds to solve any problem it is presented with. At first it gives her self defense and she escapes into the night. Then it kept her safe and hidden, isolated in peace. Here Shelly sits with her new brain. She understands how L Ron abused this power to create his cult. Shelly takes the mantle not to destroy Scientology, though she vows to do that as well. She takes it to show that this power could be used for anyone.
</p>
<p>
What does Shelly offer people? A science fiction book that ties in meditation and buddhist techniques for understanding and controlling your brain, with brain tech that helps people control their base brain functionality. Like you could have something that can flash a little light in front of your eye paired with a slim headset that measures brain waves. It lets you turn on “focus/learn” mode when you want to focus alone on a task, you could have others that keep you awake or help regulate your circadian rhythm. It is a central technology in her blockbuster hit. Maybe the alien storyline has snow crash types of more 'archaic' brain hacks, phrasing and language first shaping human thought immensely.”

  <h2>Monday Night Review</h2>
  <p>For about 8 years now, I have been trying to write down any ideas or thoughts I have or encounter that stand out as being better, worth remembering. Or trains of thought that sound promising but you don't have the time to ride them out right now. You can put down a thread and pick it up at any point. Your brain's memory process is not intentional, it generally just does its job without discrimination. You can take agency in your own memory by taking quick notes in your phone* whenever you hear or think of something you find worthwhile. These can be 1-3 words, just enough to trigger your memory.</p>
  <p>
    Monday Night Review is a practice I have been doing occasionally where I will look at recent notes and highlight the standouts, and expand on whatever seems interesting. My current plan is to make a youtube series out of this, and include written notes here as part of that. I have been successfully creating notes continuously, now I want to focus on filtering, expanding and sharing these ideas regularly. This is a way for me to generally work on expression, I am hoping to develop some video editing skills and to improve my communication by condensing and simplifying my logic.

  <h2>Cutting off trains of thought, 2 techniques and some theorizing</h2>
  <p>So blocking out everything and resetting your mind is one of the most powerful tools you can have. When you don't restart your computer it fills up with junk and works slower. So to get back to full capacity, you do your mental reset.
</p>
<p>
Mental reset- listen to music and follow the lyrics. At the same time sing a different song in your head, I often just repeat 'its gone be aaalright!' from Kendrick. On top of that, imagine yourself somewhere you feel very comfortable, maybe it's raining there. You can add smell, feel the humid/crisp air. Once you have it all going, you are clear.** How many layers you need varies
</p>
<p>
**I'm not sure yet on how long is ideal to sit in that state. In the hospital when I felt the most physically depressed on the roller coaster day of them changing my meds, this technique worked instantly for me, it seemed like magic. But I think the female brain can hold more things at once, so they might need to use more layers.***
</p>
<p>
*** What if that causes the bell curve differences for male and female performance. The proposition is that women have a harder time resetting their brain but that means they can stay on task better. They hold more things at once because they keep their trains of thought alive. While men, they are better at being 'dumb', not thinking about anything. We can more easily cut off our trains of thought, which is a tool that can help us come up with new ideas and be mindful, or trap us in the desires of the body, more easily pulled away from focus, impulsive. At the highest level of intelligence though, I suspect that logic matters more than hardware. Women can use techniques like these, men can strengthen their focus. But when we look at the distribution differences, something as small as this could be responsible for the full difference, because this is the foundation of thought. Do you let your brain traversed by continuous trains of thought that occupy most of the time? Or are you continually reacting to the world around you and tying it back other things on your mind as you go? It can be scary to stop a train of thought you like. But if you can put it down and pick it up later from an expected cue or a quick note, your brain will be working in the background and whatever you experience can help you lay new tracks for that train, so it can go down more paths than if it had just raced down the one.
</p>

Mental reset 2- Focusing on your peripheral vision. When you do so, part of your brain happens to turn off, and your inner monologue is turned off. I am still new to this one

  <h2>2023 Update</h2>
  <p>
    In 2022 I focused on improving my habits and designing them around my knowledge of neuroscience and psychology. I started the year targeting 7 daily habits (including this website I'm up to 8). My concept is I want to fill my day up with the things I want to do long term. I am also working on a vice tracking model, but I've been primarily concerned with filling time with positive actions. Here is where they stand:
  </p>
  <p>
    Meditation is my biggest success so far. I had a 10 minute daily practice going at the beginning of the year. At the end of May I bumped it up to 20 minutes. On June 19th, I read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5261734/">a neuroscience study</a> of people who have meditated over 10,000 hours. Their brain scans show unique activity, constant gamma brain wave activity (the fastest type of brain wave), and improvement in areas like empathy, which is supercharged. Basically, Nirvana is real, so since then I've been meditating an hour a day so I can reach Nirvana sometime before 2050.
  </p>
  <p>
    Walking. I was ahead of my goal of 10,000 steps/day until the December cold and the holiday parties left me short. That is a win for me, my goal in walking tracking is to make sure I am hitting a minimum level of activity every day. In 2023, I want to keep up that minimum without caring about the number of steps listed in my phone. I spent too much time caring about it. I want to take at least one walk a day and only check my steps to see if I am below 6,000 for the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reading. I've done a lot here but have far to go. I've been somewhat consistent, I made steady progress on my neuroscience book. For that, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and aim for reading at least 2 pages. I scatter books around my house but still reach for my computer too often. I've begun making it a bedtime routine with some success (only fun books at night). My highlights for the year are the first Wheel of Time book, and Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver (it takes place during the Glorious Revolution and it is oddly accurate, what a weird time).
  </p>
  <p>
    Yoga. I had some strong yoga runs, on the year I think I hit over 50% of days? I'll need my app to calculate that for me. I feel strong here, I am still getting a lot out of my 10-18 minute routine. I'm going gradually deeper into my stretches, so I feel great about where I am at with this one. Daily yoga makes such a massive difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exercise. My performance here has been pretty weak overall, but strong at times. I had some stretches of strong cardio work when it was warm, and I have a jump rope and row machine now to help me in the winter. I'm optimistic about the jump rope, and am slowly getting used to it. At the end of the year I started doing my weighted pullups routine again, I am hoping to actually get into lifting this year. At the end of 2023, I want to be doing 50 pullups with 50 pounds of weight at least once a week. (Currenly I am at 32 pounds and manage 25 with, 25 without).
  </p>
  <p>
    Creative Writing. I've been very consistent with this, any notes I take in my phone count. But I haven't gone deep at all. I have exercises to try out. This year I want to try writing longer things, like screenwriting or longer versions of my sci fi or fan fic ideas. I want to start holding regular rap camps, which will just be some friends coming over for brunch alongside trying out group writing exercises.
  </p>
  <p>
    Music. This has mostly been piano for me, along with some singing and rap practice. I'll do 10-15 minutes of exercies then go through my piano book. After that I love to freestyle, slamming the keys. In 2023 I'm trying out recording myself more often. The inspiration is that when I rap freestyle, there is the desire to write down any banger lines, but that interrupts the flow. So now I occasionally turn on my mic and record the piano as well. It's been weird so far but it's helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working on the Waldgrave. So editing this site mainly. I've been focused on creating content, not showing it. So this year I hope to clean up the site so it can properly host the content I will be publishing. This is by far my least consistent item.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a weekly habit that I have neglected called 'Monday Night Review'. Here I look at all notes of the past week and select the ones that seem interesting. Before I have elaborated on those ideas or shared them with a friend. I am considering doing it as a youtube series and including them here.
