  {/* <h2>Monday Night Review- 4/17/23</h2>
  <p>MNR TLDR: I try to record the best ideas I have or that I hear. The base concept is that your memory has no magic that makes you remember your best ideas and forget all your bad ideas. But with just a few words, you can create a memory file for yourself. A quick note in your phone can bring you back to a train of thought at any time. Monday Night Review is my process for reviewing these notes on a regular basis. My volume of ideas far exceeds my capacity to execute them, so I want to develop the habit of sharing them. I want to get more elaborate over time and make youtube videos, but for now I'm just going to focus on sharing what content I can and Auto-GPT will fill in the rest.</p>
  <p></p> */}


  <h2>Monday Night Review- Story Time</h2>
  <p>The purpose of Monday Night Review is to share the top ideas I heard or came up with recently, to list out interesting notes and to expand on the best. In ideal state, I will be doing this every week or two. I want to practice writing more stories, exploring the concepts deeper. This clashes with my desire to get more ideas out, but I think I need to slow down and become a better writer before I can properly share my ideas on a weekly basis. In this edition, I have 4 stories: fan fiction, conspiracy, philosophy, and more fan fiction with some saucy new notes on Snape's Unspeakable Appendix.</p>


  <h5>The Purple Power Ranger</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>
    Zordon has the team, and the green solo ranger, and has them work together sometimes too.
  </p>
  <p>

    The Purple ranger is given full reign with the alien technology and incorporates it into modern technology. It's like a zordon operating system so he focuses on putting observation bots everywhere, to be used in combination with an artillery system on the moon and in various satellites in orbit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tv show rangers are just Zordon trying to see if humans could do it themselves. Several times the team actually fails and the world is at risk, but the orbital strike comes in right as they fail, causing the classic explosions when a villain is killed. They assume they won though.
  </p>
  </div>

  <h5>Scott Foster Conspiracy (Current NBA referee, made 134 phone calls to the only ref caught for gambling, Tim Donaghy)</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>
    The reason Donaghy didn't talk to Scott Foster in front of his gambling partners (Donny shared hookers in the same bed as these men). He was afraid of Scott Foster. Scotty don't fuck around. They were great friends, but Scott makes sure you have every reason to never cross him. Scott has been much more careful than Donny. He slowly expanded his network, only ever opening up after gaining significant leverage. At that point he makes a strong offer, giving you a large chunk of what you make for the Business. All you have to do is make calls to slightly favor a team or a player. Scott Foster is playing the long game, before the recent betting revolution, they only bet on teams. They would roll dice to decide which games to influence, and they would try to make it happen with calls. Thanks to long term view, they could influence only a few plays a game and affect the betting line.
    </p>
    <p>

    But that is pre-gambling revolution. Now thanks to prop bets and everything, Scott Foster just runs an algorithm which gives them different bets to influence so they can operate without any visible traces. The refs are given prop bets that they choose from. They need to be randomized, but they can still choose favorites within that, the high volume of sports betting makes that easier for them. They only need to win more than they lose. Scott Foster used the NBA's coverup of the gambling problem as his in. Scott Foster is the NBA now, this is his game. He gets his cut from every game, and has blackmailed and wooed his way into firm control over his boss, ensuring he and his silent partners keep the operation running smoothly.

  <h5>The B-side of Buddha</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>

This is my book name, dibs (the wayback machine will record this dibs eternally, storing it until humanity perishes so respect it)
</p>
<p>
The Buddha left 2 instructions, the first is his direct teachings for the masses. He discovered a path towards enlightenment that worked when he tested it with his students.
</p>
<p>
The second is for people who seek their own path in the way the Buddha did. It's a somewhat obvious gap when you think about it, he teaches the path but doesn't teach finding your own path, even though the Buddha himself found enlightenment without similar guidance. The Buddha teaching about finding your own path openly would hurt his primary cause and confuse his students, he wants to share his path. The Buddha's life mission is to improve the world by teaching his path to everyone. But we are talking about the Buddha, he didn't let that stop him from trying to teach everyone.
</p>
<p>
  That is why I believe the Buddha used reincarnation. Someone finding their own path is continually experiencing death and rebirth as they grow. They leave their past selves behind. Every night when you go to sleep, you brain is edited. You as a live process dies. When you reboot, you are running on a brain that has been slightly updated since you last used it. As many have learned in the past decade, updates can cause problems too. Good Karma is Good Code. When you are nice to people, practice gratitude, and engage in positive self talk, you build a brain that is kinder, more thankful, and encourages you. Buddha Bud tells us that one of the ways karma reflects back on us is in the physical world. When you are nice to someone, they are nice back. This can be true for several reasons.
</p>
  <p>
  But Bud also goes on to say that good deeds today will also affect your Karma for future lives. This is where I think a lot of western readers turn off, when in reality it is actually where it gets particularly exciting for westerners. We don't believe in reincarnation. It seems like the Jesus resurrection bullshit, a tacky story added to the history of good person to make them more holy in remembrance. (As an aside, Jesus 'returned from the dead' only to 'ascend to heaven'? Where did he go while he was dead? Why does everyone pretend he beat death? He sounds more like a greek mythology character that 'escaped' Hades with a really long chain still attached). The Buddha never gave some definitive evidence that he had past lives or proof of future lives. I believe this is key, Bud seems hella practical. He used existing ideas of Karma to get people to care more about being kind and dutiful in this life, even if you didn't like this life you could work towards the next. He wasn't trying to fix his whole society at once, but he was trying to provide help to everyone in the society.
  </p>
  <p>
  So the Buddha included reincarnation, but I believe he was able to speak to both audiences by talking about consciousness in its base components. We are trains of thought and the mechanisms for navigating between those trains and stopping and starting them. As we grow and learn (good karma) or forget and neglect (bad karma), we edit the tracks and connections of our brains. So for major growth, one has to be willing to die to become someone new. If you work hard to be a kind person, you will wake up inside a kinder mind. So if you see something about reincarnation, consider it within the context of neuroscience and neuroplasticity.

  <h5>The Half-Blood Prince's Unspeakable Appendix (maybe the author of this story is the book?)</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>

So James and his friends learn how to transform into animals. This was a fairly remarkable feat for a Hogwarts student, especially after the ban on underage magic. Most students didn't have the time, but James and Sirius didn't care much for grades, and the lot of them were animals already. Snape hated them, but he hated being outdone more. So he delves into dark magic in order to perfect transfiguration. Instead of becoming one animal, Snape learns how to transform himself completely. He focuses on transforming into other humans. He eventually masters the two he secretly observed the most, and he uses this to spend time with Lily as James.
</p>
<p>

Memory charm mastery. I hear Lockheart get a lot of crap for only knowing one spell, but memory charms are the first area of study of nearly every dark lord of the past 3 centuries. It is what allows them to amass enough power to become a dark lord before they are caught as a dark peasant. He doesn't just knock out James, he gives James his own memories so no one figures out the substitution. He gets pretty used to stuffing James in a trunk, making up excuses to disappear so he can live James's life. What's the harm? He's a little shit anyways, this a magical intervention he doesn't deserve.
</p>
<p>
Dumbledore is the only one who notices. DD also has a distaste for the cocky James and has had his fair share of fucked up experiments. Snape actually molds James into a good person through the memory implants and other experiments. DD recognizes Snapes brilliance and recruits him. Because the reality of magic is that Hogwarts is a sham ever since they stopped teaching dark magic.
</p>
<p>

Don't get me confused, DD didn't endorse evil, but magic is magic, and an evil wizard has no limits. They would have no chance if they followed ministry law, Grindelwald would have been the best case scenario. The rest are scrubbed from collective memory, their knowledge would otherwise guarantee mass destruction. So the Headmaster has a secret responsibility to develop students in secret, to find trustworthy talents, to give them dangerous knowledge and to supervise their experiments.
</p>
<p>

Dumbledore gave out some of this knowledge, but Snape is the only one to fully earn his trust. DD leaves behind tips for harry and others, but they only get the real access if Snape and DD die. So when Harry goes to face Voldemort in the forest, the deathly hallows are misdirection. Within Harry's right brain is all of DD and Snapes knowledge, designed to only be available as needed. What really lets Harry win is not some matching phoenix feather, it is magic beyond the knowledge of any living being.
</p>
<p>

Snape gets into Harry's head during their ocxlumency lessons, making it easy. DD does most of his work while Harry is 'recovering' from one of his many disasters. Each time he stays a week longer just for DD to do his work
</p>
<h5>
Scattered Snippets
</h5>
<p>
"DD and Snape are the wealthiest people in the world thanks to abusing arbitrage, maybe they have fancy vacations together. Like Snape is a James bond with a country's power behind him, but it's an extremely small operation. Like gringotts doesn't abuse arbitrage just because this group tells them not to, the head goblin is part of the group. Power respects power. So Snape starts small and is always running into DD without knowing it. Like stories of god coming as different people but it's DD.""
</p>
<p>

Dumbledore develops a reincarnation spell, like Buddha immortality. He is Merlin, or was once. Each time he slowly finds memories he hid. Not every lifetime manages to activate the DNA memory though, its epigenetic magic. The Dark Ages had no Merlin, because he was raised with too much violence and too little curiosity.
</p>
<p>

"For this appendix I used a similar magic. I opened for you because you had the requisite epigenetic activation. Don't worry though, I'm the "good" one, that's why DD needs me. He's too damn old, morality has changed a bit since he started. I won't take over your body, I am just using memory for information transfer."
</p>
<p>
"Don't trust DD. Listen to him, do what he says. But never trust. Trust yourself, your instinct, your morality. That is not a man, that is an abomination. I considered keeping my own secrets, but what happens if the Merlin experiment goes rogue? So Welcome to Snape's Secrets. You are now burdened with the care of the most dangerous being ever."
</p>
<p>
"Have you been to the dungeons yet? If you wander long enough looking for darkness, the hallway will end at a wall with 2 unlit torches. Light that with the ameratsu dark flame spell from chapter 12. Salazar's labs lie beyond. Generation after generation of Hogwarts students passed through here without knowing thanks to memory charms. Dumbledore has been building this up for a while. The information disparity compared to Hogwarts libraries is massive. It's as if the knowledge of quantum physics were hidden away. The difference is that the nuclear bomb equivalent in magic could threaten spacetime itself, so I can't blame the guy. No one should know some of the things I know."

  <h2>MNR- another late night speedrun</h2>
  <h5>A few random notes from the week then my latest Harry Potter fan fic, Snape's Unspeakable Appendix (I edited it a little but it is too late for more. also probably assumed for HP fanfic but nsfw warning)</h5>
  <p>
  "O'Hare cell phone lot secret base. You park over one of the right spaces and you can sneak through the bottom of your car into the base. The car adds a fake you via screens on the windows."
  </p>
  <p>
  "Plot: MC is trying to beat chatgpt, to upgrade it so they cannot be detected. They find a way to fool all current types of tests, but there is an inherent flaw, the patterns just have a different paradigm. MC is still able to detect their own work, so they consider it a failure at first, they couldn't sell a product as better if it was reliably detectable as well.

Out of curiosity, MC has their trained AI evaluate some current data. The numbers are staggering, how?! How could this many people be using a tech that isn't even publicly known?? The implications: a secret organization of some form is recruiting or taking over in mass. Aliens? Illuminati? At this rate Whoever will have the majority of human communication under control within the week.

How do we stop this? It's a secret war by their choice, we need to go public but how? Their takeover is focused on who is grabbing eyeballs, so most news stations risk exposure and capture. We need to send out a message that has no trace. One which anyone can listen to and confirm the truth of our words. The proof is a better than a signature.

I don't know what we are fighting, but if I can make sure everyone at least knows we are in a fight, then I know someone can do something."
  </p>
  <p>
  "Moving in time isn't inherent, we have momentum in time. Thus, we could slow down our time in exchange for massive energy gains. Like with hydrogen fusion and the strong force but our local spacetime is already in motion, so we would have it turn our spacetime turbine like a windmill.

There are 2 main rewards, first is the energy, it could be massive. And second is that we gain access to 2 timelines of influence. We can send out robots to experiment, harvest and build across the galaxy outside of our slowed down bubble. People can choose to come and go as well, so a researcher inside the bubble could make a generational breakthrough and get generations's worth of feedback and additions and corrections. Before a top researchers might have been lucky to see peers or students advance their theories, but the Inside researchers and entertainers see their works as they hold up to successive generations. Most is inevitably trashed, much to the dismay of the Inners. The Inners are basically seen as a mix of revered and reviled gods, reality tv fame hunters, and legitimate reality tv gold. The modest ones often end up with their own cult following and thus fall into the diety type. Most of the Inner world is still a mystery though, as you only hear from whoever chooses to broadcast and that isn't most people.

Endgame is simulations because then you have no time constraints, just energy, limiting your ability to speed up and create more time through that enhanced processing. And because the source is the "field" of time"

  Snape's unspeakable appendix.
  </h5>
  <p>

Snape actually found a spell similar to the horcrux diary but without a piece of soul. This magical intelligence evaluated the reader's morality like the marauders map, sorting hat or room of requirements. If you appear morally good, the book shares all its pro tips and advice. If the book likes you, if it feels friendship towards you, you are given a special offer: "take an unbreakable vow to never share this information and receive my darkest teachings. Otherwise I will erase your memory of this moment and you will go back to thinking there is no appendix."
</p>
<p>
"We lurk in the dark to hunt the Dark."
</p>
<p>
Welcome. This appendix is curiosity explored with guidance of my dark arts code.
</p>
<p>
Knowledge is power. Magic is too mysterious to be calculated in theory, so the newest and most dangerous magic is not discovered by the Dumbledore's of the world. DD has a fatal flaw, he mastered all magic he used, but his code keeps him in the dark. He gained a tremendous amount of power and knowledge by learning from past wizards through cryptic readings hidden within Howarts and whatever secret hoards it holds. But when it came to the big, dangerous stuff like magical fusion reactors, his own research was forced to be theoretical only. No one would let a student do that, so young DD just told his friend Grindelwald this instead, among many other explosive ideas. Convinced DD's ideas must be pursued on a grand scale, GW organizes his war. Either GW takes over and forces people to do them, or DD stops him and gets the clout to make a difference. Say what you will about ole Grindy, he understood humans and strategy far better. Dumbledore is stuck wearing a mask all the time, says I was the first in a while to see through it. He really is brilliant, but he’s far too kind for the dark arts. So I will be his source of knowledge of the dark arts. I will
</p>
<p>
Knowledge comes from everywhere. So we must be everywhere and listen. I found out how the potter prick and his friends sneak around so easily, a tracking map! The tech is insane, there's no way those dumb jocks made it. How can someone lose track of something like that? In any case, I slipped the fat one a potion and took the map off of him, and imperious'ed him into a lovely drinking spree throughout hogsmeade and the girls dormitory of each house, ending in the prefects' bath with an eclectic group of hooligans. Felix Felicis is the first secret potion I will teach you. It's rare because anyone that has a better method keeps it secret, like most high end potions. It's a scary thing to abuse any potion though. So I have been testing it on other students. This is Pig's 3rd time, maybe I should be more careful, but I needed to study that map with an excuse for it to be anyone. Literally anywhere, I had him go out on an apparating trip to pick me up black market materials.
</p>
<p>
But back to the map, knowledge is ours. I've extended the mapping technology, magical computing is being explored with it and we have eyes and ears on any target, anywhere in the world. It seems like magic is creating a quantum link between the map and any region of spacetime. Jormungand, I present to you the World Serpent. we can see and hear anywhere, and can search through everywhere. This is your power to use how you see fit. Your use of this book means you are fundamentally worthy, but know that I am cold blooded, calculated, a bit sadistic. I have no shame, I see what I want to see, I invite you to do the same.
</p>
<p>
No shame does not mean no respect. If you fall in love with a girl, don't use a love potion if she doesn't love you back. Instead, get a time turner, polyjuice potion and some of her hair. Walk into a room, set the materials to the side, note the time and close your eyes. Open them as your crush walks in, fuck them. Then clean yourself up, polyjuice yourself and change clothes, exit the room, time turn, walk in and enjoy the fucking you just delivered. Optionally, you can cast a temporary memory charm and imperius curse on yourself so you think you are the girl and don't remember it. This is beneficial for the time stability side, you won't have to worry about creating a continuous loop because you will just be reacting, you won't be using the knowledge you gained from going back in time. Otherwise you risk fraying spacetime and being vaporized (don't ask how I know). Each time you fuck yourself a new way, you cause yourself to fuck yourself in yet a new way. And you don't know if you succeed, because you go forward with your life while the old version of you that you just fucked needs to do what you just did. Spacetime is having difficulty resolving exactly where you should be amid a potentially infinite parallel threads of spacetime. All of that pressure means you can explode. As for me, I fucked myself as Lily Potter. Carefully at first, but then I tried without the memory charm. I felt the magical resonance of my soul in thousands of timelines simultaneously. I believe I wasn't vaporized because I had faith and leaned into the moment and my feelings. I eventually converged on a stable loop. (Redacted) didn't really trust the process... The memories don't overlap though, it feels like I experienced that night hundreds of times. It is much easier to cheer on James now, I identify with Lily more after wearing her skin and just want the best for her. James is my prize pig now, I've taught him manners and a few tricks.

  <h2>MNR- a quickie</h2>
  <p>
  A little late at night so speed mode. Here are some notes, with somes notes on top of that.
</p>
<p>
99% of matter is from energy trapped inside the strong force.
</p>
<p>
“I like the idea that all advanced civilizations disappear into the micro world. They find simulations to be a pathway towards immortality and exploration. There is a bit of a time race and then it gets to a point where to exit a simulation level is to leave it for millennia, if you ever do return. So there are “real” people and then there is this massive pool of the would-be dead inside these simulations. The real people have an inherent information advantage, but they lose that quickly as the simulators have years to study for what is days on the outside. The reals anticipate this and put the simulators on guard, wanting to be safe of anyone trying to come out, as unlikely as that may seem.”
</p>
<p>
I like this concept a lot because it gives a good reason for why we don't see advanced civilizations. They are so small that they don't show up on our telescopes, and most of the population is in the sims. It also means that we could be invaded easily by such a civilization, as they would react to us using their time and size advantage to get in unnoticed.
</p>

“Carl decides not to rush time travel. He learns from an early visitor when he had his original breakthrough. To keep continuity, Carl decides to not invent it again before the same time. He ignores time travelers and pretends they are crazy“    - Electric Forest-centered time traveler. He keeps coming back to certain places, but because he keeps his cool and sticks to his plan, he doesn't disrupt the timeline. He is super careful. Once he finally does discover time travel though, at the proper time, he has a lot of dope plans. Post-invention Carl doesn't hold back though, he is all over the place and completely unpredictable. So many, many times different Carls past come along to try to subtly give advice, wallow in their own misery, or to battle other time travelers. OG Carl is unfazed, he may be the youngest but he has the latest and best advice to draw from. The character development ends up focusing on the different future’s past Carls and their philosophical differences.
</p>
<p>
“Space themed show like star trek but it exists at the cellular level. They are the People's Navy, they sail only inside of people mainly. There is much risk turning large again so a race of little people is born.
</p>
<p>
Our character is new to the mini mission and thinks he will be transformed back. No one told him the odds of surviving were 1/10 and the odds of not having debilitating pain were 0/768 trials so far on record. So when he is captured, he willingly adapts and learns the new life.
</p>
<p>
MC brings promise of a "cure", a new revival technique his boss was working on. He believed the lies because he thought the corporation would be way ahead of them, not decades behind. MC teaches the concepts to the little people and their tech army finishes the job. The little people gain the ability to transform at will and they have invaded every politically or militarily significant person, maybe even every person. Tracking them is difficult, no one has ever scanned negative, or would if they could make such a scan. The little people seize power instantly, a globally televised event via hacking the visual cortexes of the world. Most of the globe capitulates in the first 30 seconds, we ask if anyone wants to test us, please ask how so that we may limit violent waste. They have the eyes of every key target, anyone who reaches for the proverbial gun explodes into thousands of pieces, destroyed from within. Hesitation is permitted, the rest are engaged in personal debate by the people living inside of them. the operators who have seen everything, more than the people themselves.
</p>
<p>
MC is disillusioned so they give the tech to the other side. This let's them kill and extract the little people inside them. It's like murdering a planet each time in terms of sentient lives lost.
</p>
<p>
MC sees that they are worse and goes back to the little people. They get ahold of the global mini network and learn how to transport people out. They evacuate whole people who are then murdered for the cause.“
</p>
<p>
scientology fan fiction (basically my psychological thriller but with Shelly as MC)
</p>
<p>
Shelly finds a secret left by Hubbard and escapes down the rabbit hole of this sci fi discovery. I gotta read a scientology summary and make up her story based on that. Like mix in Hubbard's wacky aliens with brainwaves and neural patterns. The idea that if the brain is a computer, someone else could write code in your brain and you would ride those thought paths. But how you react to them is still yours and yours alone. The active thought process is still a complex operation using so many parts together.
</p>
<p>
Shelly achieves what L. Ron only discovered in theory, she programs an alien pattern into her brain and begins to gain an enhanced consciousness which proceeds to solve any problem it is presented with. At first it gives her self defense and she escapes into the night. Then it kept her safe and hidden, isolated in peace. Here Shelly sits with her new brain. She understands how L Ron abused this power to create his cult. Shelly takes the mantle not to destroy Scientology, though she vows to do that as well. She takes it to show that this power could be used for anyone.
</p>
<p>
What does Shelly offer people? A science fiction book that ties in meditation and buddhist techniques for understanding and controlling your brain, with brain tech that helps people control their base brain functionality. Like you could have something that can flash a little light in front of your eye paired with a slim headset that measures brain waves. It lets you turn on “focus/learn” mode when you want to focus alone on a task, you could have others that keep you awake or help regulate your circadian rhythm. It is a central technology in her blockbuster hit. Maybe the alien storyline has snow crash types of more 'archaic' brain hacks, phrasing and language first shaping human thought immensely.”

  <h2>Monday Night Review</h2>
  <p>For about 8 years now, I have been trying to write down any ideas or thoughts I have or encounter that stand out as being better, worth remembering. Or trains of thought that sound promising but you don't have the time to ride them out right now. You can put down a thread and pick it up at any point. Your brain's memory process is not intentional, it generally just does its job without discrimination. You can take agency in your own memory by taking quick notes in your phone* whenever you hear or think of something you find worthwhile. These can be 1-3 words, just enough to trigger your memory.</p>
  <p>
    Monday Night Review is a practice I have been doing occasionally where I will look at recent notes and highlight the standouts, and expand on whatever seems interesting. My current plan is to make a youtube series out of this, and include written notes here as part of that. I have been successfully creating notes continuously, now I want to focus on filtering, expanding and sharing these ideas regularly. This is a way for me to generally work on expression, I am hoping to develop some video editing skills and to improve my communication by condensing and simplifying my logic.
  </p>
  <p>*app in progress</p>
  <h2>Cutting off trains of thought, 2 techniques and some theorizing</h2>
  <p>So blocking out everything and resetting your mind is one of the most powerful tools you can have. When you don't restart your computer it fills up with junk and works slower. So to get back to full capacity, you do your mental reset.
</p>
<p>
Mental reset- listen to music and follow the lyrics. At the same time sing a different song in your head, I often just repeat 'its gone be aaalright!' from Kendrick. On top of that, imagine yourself somewhere you feel very comfortable, maybe it's raining there. You can add smell, feel the humid/crisp air. Once you have it all going, you are clear.** How many layers you need varies
</p>
<p>
**I'm not sure yet on how long is ideal to sit in that state. In the hospital when I felt the most physically depressed on the roller coaster day of them changing my meds, this technique worked instantly for me, it seemed like magic. But I think the female brain can hold more things at once, so they might need to use more layers.***
</p>
<p>
*** What if that causes the bell curve differences for male and female performance. The proposition is that women have a harder time resetting their brain but that means they can stay on task better. They hold more things at once because they keep their trains of thought alive. While men, they are better at being 'dumb', not thinking about anything. We can more easily cut off our trains of thought, which is a tool that can help us come up with new ideas and be mindful, or trap us in the desires of the body, more easily pulled away from focus, impulsive. At the highest level of intelligence though, I suspect that logic matters more than hardware. Women can use techniques like these, men can strengthen their focus. But when we look at the distribution differences, something as small as this could be responsible for the full difference, because this is the foundation of thought. Do you let your brain traversed by continuous trains of thought that occupy most of the time? Or are you continually reacting to the world around you and tying it back other things on your mind as you go? It can be scary to stop a train of thought you like. But if you can put it down and pick it up later from an expected cue or a quick note, your brain will be working in the background and whatever you experience can help you lay new tracks for that train, so it can go down more paths than if it had just raced down the one.
</p>
<p>
Mental reset 2- Focusing on your peripheral vision. When you do so, part of your brain happens to turn off, and your inner monologue is turned off. I am still new to this one
</p>
  <h2>2023 Update</h2>
  <p>
    In 2022 I focused on improving my habits and designing them around my knowledge of neuroscience and psychology. I started the year targeting 7 daily habits (including this website I'm up to 8). My concept is I want to fill my day up with the things I want to do long term. I am also working on a vice tracking model, but I've been primarily concerned with filling time with positive actions. Here is where they stand:
  </p>
  <p>
    Meditation is my biggest success so far. I had a 10 minute daily practice going at the beginning of the year. At the end of May I bumped it up to 20 minutes. On June 19th, I read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5261734/">a neuroscience study</a> of people who have meditated over 10,000 hours. Their brain scans show unique activity, constant gamma brain wave activity (the fastest type of brain wave), and improvement in areas like empathy, which is supercharged. Basically, Nirvana is real, so since then I've been meditating an hour a day so I can reach Nirvana sometime before 2050.
  </p>
  <p>
    Walking. I was ahead of my goal of 10,000 steps/day until the December cold and the holiday parties left me short. That is a win for me, my goal in walking tracking is to make sure I am hitting a minimum level of activity every day. In 2023, I want to keep up that minimum without caring about the number of steps listed in my phone. I spent too much time caring about it. I want to take at least one walk a day and only check my steps to see if I am below 6,000 for the day.

    Reading. I've done a lot here but have far to go. I've been somewhat consistent, I made steady progress on my neuroscience book. For that, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and aim for reading at least 2 pages. I scatter books around my house but still reach for my computer too often. I've begun making it a bedtime routine with some success (only fun books at night). My highlights for the year are the first Wheel of Time book, and Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver (it takes place during the Glorious Revolution and it is oddly accurate, what a weird time).

    Yoga. I had some strong yoga runs, on the year I think I hit over 50% of days? I'll need my app to calculate that for me. I feel strong here, I am still getting a lot out of my 10-18 minute routine. I'm going gradually deeper into my stretches, so I feel great about where I am at with this one. Daily yoga makes such a massive difference.

    Exercise. My performance here has been pretty weak overall, but strong at times. I had some stretches of strong cardio work when it was warm, and I have a jump rope and row machine now to help me in the winter. I'm optimistic about the jump rope, and am slowly getting used to it. At the end of the year I started doing my weighted pullups routine again, I am hoping to actually get into lifting this year. At the end of 2023, I want to be doing 50 pullups with 50 pounds of weight at least once a week. (Currenly I am at 32 pounds and manage 25 with, 25 without).

    Creative Writing. I've been very consistent with this, any notes I take in my phone count. But I haven't gone deep at all. I have exercises to try out. This year I want to try writing longer things, like screenwriting or longer versions of my sci fi or fan fic ideas. I want to start holding regular rap camps, which will just be some friends coming over for brunch alongside trying out group writing exercises.

    Music. This has mostly been piano for me, along with some singing and rap practice. I'll do 10-15 minutes of exercies then go through my piano book. After that I love to freestyle, slamming the keys. In 2023 I'm trying out recording myself more often. The inspiration is that when I rap freestyle, there is the desire to write down any banger lines, but that interrupts the flow. So now I occasionally turn on my mic and record the piano as well. It's been weird so far but it's helpful.

    Working on the Waldgrave. So editing this site mainly. I've been focused on creating content, not showing it. So this year I hope to clean up the site so it can properly host the content I will be publishing. This is by far my least consistent item.

    I have a weekly habit that I have neglected called 'Monday Night Review'. Here I look at all notes of the past week and select the ones that seem interesting. Before I have elaborated on those ideas or shared them with a friend. I am considering doing it as a youtube series and including them here.
