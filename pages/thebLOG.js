  {/* <h2>Monday Night Review- 4/17/23</h2>
  <p>MNR TLDR: I try to record the best ideas I have or that I hear. The base concept is that your memory has no magic that makes you remember your best ideas and forget all your bad ideas. But with just a few words, you can create a memory file for yourself. A quick note in your phone can bring you back to a train of thought at any time. Monday Night Review is my process for reviewing these notes on a regular basis. My volume of ideas far exceeds my capacity to execute them, so I want to develop the habit of sharing them. I want to get more elaborate over time and make youtube videos, but for now I'm just going to focus on sharing what content I can and Auto-GPT will fill in the rest.</p>
  <p></p> */}

<h2>Monday Night Review: July 2023</h2>
<p>I may edit or add to this still, I'm giving myself up to 1 week into a month to write on ideas of the previous month. I was pretty busy this month, I have a lot of notes that don't fit this format (a chunk have to do with a forest-consciousness analogy I'm cooking up, I also made progress on my Dune fan-fic: Ghanima's Embrace (name pending)). Here are some of my digestible notes:</p> {/* 18 month change advocacy? Talk about tracking process. bring in itw??? */}
<h5>Meditation round 2: practical explanation</h5>
<p>
  Meditate 5 minutes a day, focus on your breath and count your breaths to 5. Concentration is the goal, this is focus training. As thoughts come to you, acknowledge that they are separate from you. Maybe you remember something you need to do, go do that thing. Maybe you need to plan what you will do. Take care of your shit, then accept that you have done or will do what you need to do. Meditation is about raising awareness. As you raise your awareness, it's like turning on the lights. You see the mess you have made, the entirely avoidable things that you have been tripping over repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
  There is this thing that Zen buddhism focuses on, emptying yourself and the rewards that follow. We are so far gone from that, we carry an infinite source of bullshit wherever we go. Some call this reason for pessimism, but I see something else. We are massive, overflowing jugs. Stop pouring more in and you have great nourishment in front of you. But you can't drink if you keep pouring. Meditation is the act of stopping the pour and drinking. So it will be 'more difficult' for someone with an overflowing cup, but the rewards are that much greater. (That said, there are supposedly wonderful benefits of stopping the pouring entirely, as your focus is honed by the lack of bullshit). What media sources do you consume? How long can you stop the pouring into your cup? That's why the Buddha just told everyone to go fuck off into the forest on their own. No one can pour into your cup there.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/-asOA1QMGtg">This video</a> covers why you should take notes to create and maintain your second brain. I'll let Tiago advocate for notes this month. Commonplace book for yourself. The Waldgrave aims to be a collective commonplace book. Please add a list of the best of the best, the things you most recommend to another person. It can be a book, a quote, an idea, anything. As long as it's that good shit. (functionality in progress, starting with the og internet, text and hyperlinks only)

<h5>Random Notes</h5>
<ol className="randomNotes">
  <li>
    Brain Day. I propose this as a day of celebration and recognition, the day your brain has finished growing. Maybe we learn to identify that with a simple scan at your checkup, for now it can be your 25th birthday. It is an important distinction that we should recognize. You didn't make your brain, you came into existence within it at some point during its development and joined in the development process. Brain day is about recognizing when a vital biological process is complete. I don't think we help young people appropriately because of a lack of awareness of brain growth.
  </li>
  <li className="story">
  what if the human brain conducts simulations with versions of “you” being passed different thoughts and perceptions. So it may decide to imagine trying out both types of soup, and then “you” would experience soup but no memory is stored. Your brain could constantly be creating fake you’s. Like ‘Joan is Awful’, but it is you inside of you. As long as your brain has the processing power, it could trap you in simulations.
  </li>
  <li>
  Free the algorithms. No one should force you to search data with particular obscured searched alone. New law.
  </li>
  <li>
  Public bar cart app. So if you have friends over, they can check what you already have on tap and ready for guests. And public pantry for dinner parties.
  </li>
  <li>
  For 5 minutes a day, don't let anybody or anything run your brain. Create space to hear your brain.
  </li>
  <li>
  Big newspaper is behind deep fakes. The destruction of online truth makes them relevant again, except there might be some protected networks hosting mini-internets everywhere. The danger is that your system can be hacked without you knowing it. Delivery boys will be a critical service like never before.
  </li>
  <li>
    Science still doesn't know where the mind is. The mind plays the brain like a piano and we can observe the brain, but the mind remains a mystery. Your mind is an organ, your brain is your physical karma.
  </li>
  <li>
  Cicadas are the first small bots to be feared. During bloom, they are perfect cover.
  </li>
  <li>
  Mario party infinite
<br/>
Every mario party game exists in the same board universe. What happens in your games shapes the boards forever. So the board universe is both changing and growing over time. Games abandoned halfway through create chaos because side characters escape and roam as unchecked, neglected npc's.
<br/>
There are an infinite, ever-growing number of copies of every character in the game. Every time you play, you create new ones. But the geography is dynamically changing in response to in-game decisions and outcomes.
  </li>
  <li>
  I think the ability to launch to a black hole and live forever (or to the big end) with the energy of a black hole and simulate universes is a seed that lives in all humans now. That's what makes us potential gods.
  </li>
  <li>
  So someone attacks Japan, and the ninjas are finally called upon. They got real good with new technology, no one is safe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Goals are the future affecting the present, the sibling of history.
  </li>
  <li>
  B-connect
<br/>
Turn all messaging systems into one messaging system of your choice
<br/>
Do you prefer texting for some things and slack for other things, but the people you communicate with have different preferences?
<br/>
Those two things are needlessly connected currently. But you are recieving the data, how you handle that data should be your choice.
<br/>

Whether something goes into one type of message platform or another should be set by you, along with how and when you were notified about these messages. Message sources point at notification rules.
  </li>
  <li>
  Thinking is the collapsing of your brainwave function. You have all these potential paths, and they shape which path you end up taking. By creating space, you open yourself to the wave of possibilities. Meditation helps you quiet the mind.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you jump off one train of thought and then get on another, what's the in-between?
  </li>
  <li>
  So fungus wins the extinction event, has a massive feast and spawns a consciousness. This being awakens to a dead world. They create spores so that they can one day awaken again in a world with more life to consume.
  </li>
  <li>
  What if you progressively took over one neuron at a time by taking out the sodium and potassium and replacing it with an electric source controlled by a computer? The sodium and potassium only have an effect through the electrical output they produce.
  </li>
  <li>
  my proposal is  that galaxies are eventually spread out enough that the space in between them “breaks”, it no longer has the energy to support the new space. it is like the end of the universe, I think the result is that the galaxies collapse into its own new big bang. mid bangs?
  <br/>
  So each galaxy collapses separately but not to a point. The whole galaxy falls into the supermassive black hole at the center.
  <br/>
We have detected galaxies "too big" too far away. Some suggest the universe is older than we thought. I propose that our universe was once a galaxy in a larger universe, it collapsed into a black hole and the X event occurs. The distribution of everything causes new clumps to form as the X event explodes outwards. Energy is concentrated enough to spontaneously create new spacetime. It expands in all directions until it cools again.
<br/>
Aliens with black hole technology could have created our universe around themselves.
<br/>
Our universe isn't infinite, the aliens were at true center. But every other point also looks like true center, spacetime expanded equally in all directions, between all points. The "walls" of our universe is running away from us faster than our speed of causality, it's infinite from our perspective, but the edge still always exists.
<br/>
Eventually, energy is too spread out to power more spacetime so the outward pressure stops. Maybe it begins collapsing, maybe it stays there, maybe it just slows down a bit. WHAT IF OUR UNIVERSE NEEDS A HIGH PRESSURE TO MAINTAIN ITS integrity?
<br/>
We need a space ark asap. We should build it inside earth. Call it Plan B. We can get the religious right on board with an ark.
<br/>
This also gets people underground in enough numbers and supplies to survive an unexpected event.
<br/>

Potential bwahh-
<br/>
The stars hold up the sky. They power the vacuum.
  </li>
  <li>
  Does time travel involve a break or a branch? Branching seems more realistic. If timelines are like a plant then, are there benefits to pruning? If there is some shared resource for the multiverse, maybe spacetime and energy, maybe computing power, how would a pruning process develop? How would it manifest?
<br/>
We hit this limit much faster with the branching of time travel. The Pruners take out any sections that are growing too fast. That is why we must stop these time travelers, no matter the cost. It's nothing personal, we prune the worst offenders ourselves, before we are all destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Augmented reality eventually kills ads and brands. They can no longer force themselves into your field of view. Though if you let them, they can control your everything.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you watched the Oppenheimer movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_the_neutron">here is the prequel</a>. There is no action like a bomb, though there is drama. One duo of scientists in Germany discovered a new particle but think it may be gamma radiation, 2 years later a second duo in Paris runs a follow-up experiment and proves that it isn't gamma radiation. The Paris duo says a new neutral particle is required. Then a British scientist, after seeing this, copies the Paris experiment and adds in his expertise for measuring ejected protons to confirm that the new neutral particle is also the size of a proton. It's only the last guy that got the Nobel Prize and the credit for 'discovering' the neutron. James Chadwick (he only has like 3 pictures online and he looks unhappy in all of them). That's enough for another go, right?

<h2>Monday Night Review: June</h2>
<p>Note taking and regular notes reviews are something I recommend everyone do. It's part of being a proper cyborg, utilizing your long term memory banks. I haven't been using reddit as much and the cutting off of the flood of new information has let me spend more time following up on the many information trails I left myself in the form of notes, open browser tabs, and books placed strategically around my house. This has improved the quality of the media I have been consuming, contributing to 26 random ideas to stir the mind. But to lead the way, we have a simulation theory followed by an app concept, 30 Questions. Once again I apologize for the lack of visual updates (or editing). June was a strong month for most of my daily goals, but this languished. While I put this post together tonight, I gained a neice. My nephew helped inspire my daily charge when he was born 2 and a half years ago. I am hoping to syphon off all of the wisdom of raising a child without having to deal with all the worst shit involved. My best heist so far has been stealing the motivation to be a good role model. I think part of it is just that I can't fathom my own mortality well, but these children growing up is a definitive timeline. And our world is too fucked up in the short-term currently. So enough is enough, I will be looking to more directly affect change. I can imagine a better tomorrow. I can prove that what I imagine is better than today. I can't really do too much else in a day, after you account for eating, sleeping, petting cats, etc. I am going to try to learn how to do so. But right now, my highest value action is sharing my ideas as food for thought, inspiration to spur you on to something greater. Eat up and let me know what you think. I launched a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/waldgrave/">subreddit</a> where you can post any questions, comments or feedback about anything Waldgrave. (As you can tell by my username, I'm not a fan of the company, but the community forum structure is still great) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/waldgrave/">reddit.com/r/waldgrave</a> </p>

<h5>What's better, one or two? The story of how eye doctors trapped the world in a simulation without anyone noticing</h5>
<div className="story">
  <p>
Our reality can be reduced down to chemical and electrical circuits that take in thousands to ~100,000+ inputs and return a single output, an action that opens ion channels that boost the action that opens more ion channels, until there is an output. That many-to-one relationship is used many times over with many different interneurons in many patterns. Thanks to the many-to-one nature, many disparate stimuli can be incorporated into one. By understanding the brain systems at the highest level, a clever scientist could find a way to completely control the brain's output with minimal interference.
</p><p>
You sit on the endpoints near the consciousness part of the brain for the different senses. You observe the input/output until you can imitate anything. Then you imitate everything. Slowly improve your craft until they don't notice anything. These people will not notice a thing, we have strict guidelines on what you can do. We will not be caught, we are all monitered by the system in our head. It is safe to think about betraying the GUIdelines, quite dangerous to act upon it though. The Program takes threats seriously. We are all subject to the autonomous monitoring, so we really don't want to be killed accidentally. Just please, don't take any willing action against the GUIdelines.
</p><p>
Back to the Macro scale:
</p><p>
We have these different human systems, we have active processes that are constantly operating so we eat and drink and see and hear and feel and think. All of these systems feed ultimately to the system that is us, the prefrontal cortex and all.
</p><p>
As we take over enough people's perception, we can expand through using them in our delivery network. Essentially, we are taking over their bodies without them even knowing something happened. The only requirement is that we don't manipulate perception where someone not in the system could point out the discrepancy. We already have every lasik patient in the past 5 years, 80% of all people who go to the eye doctor, anyone who uses eye makeup, and eye drop users.
</p><p>
This is where you recruits come in. We need novel ways to get into people's brains. We're already in every new shower head, but that's the kind of long game coverage we are looking for. Or if you could transform it, could you reach more people now?

<h5>30 Questions- a definitive path to your intellectual match(es)</h5>
<div className="story">
  <p>30 questions, only 2 possible answers for each question. You pick or create 30 different questions that you think define who you are. You can make more than one list. Maybe one set is 30 questions all meant to eliminate anyone but you. Your second set could be focused on making sure any matches share your particular tastes across the board. I think I would want a few defined 'primary' set types to filter on. The question sets are initially kept private until at least 1000 people have added it or something. Then people can start answering each other's questions. It doesn't tell you if you got a question "wrong". But it gives you streak indicators every 5 questions if you are giving the same response as the set creator. You never see the same set twice. If you answer all 30 questions the same as the set creator intended, you gain permanant access to a chat room with the set creator and other people who answered the same. Ideally, the chat room has some infrastructure for information sharing besides just a chat room, but that's not really necessary. The important part is to connect these like-minded individuals across purely intellectual lines, defying geography, time, and maybe even subject, depending on how you make your 30 questions.</p>

  You can walk without thinking about it, while focused on other things. You can play piano with two hands but only focus directly on one at once. you can inhabit the higher level strategic thinking area of your brain.

  Software that looks at your brain's physical mapping, and then can take action based on when you think of a location. My first creation would be The Instrument. Every thing becomes every instrument. Like if I start playing the piano on a table, it plays out of my speakers or in my headphones. If you star riffing on a broom, it's a guitar.

  Meditation post, you don't think, thinking is something that happens to you. You are at the top of the information food chain, you can inspect any single source but you are still taking in the combined output of everything going on with your body and mind. You are constantly recieving thoughts and you can either engage or disengage.
<br/>
"Awareness" is taking in the stimuli around you without generating thoughts. Your mind is still working, but you aren't hanging on to judgments and evaluations. This clears out extra capacity for your brain to act in the moment. No mental labels

It is because black holes are fuzzballs. Eventually gravity crushes protons and neutrons into new matter. This new matter, with its stringy nature, adapts into intelligent life much faster than atom-based life. So any black hole you travel to will have some form of intelligent life inside.

  Lately I like the term emergent property, I think stopping reddit shows me something. Computers have different storage based on how far away from the CPU it is. There is a limited amount actually connected to the CPU, other memory is extremely slow in comparison. Our brains are the same, digital memory is extremely slower, but has other superior qualities while still operating similarly. Stopping an information source like reddit drastically slows the inflow of information into your extra memory. This means you process the rest of your information more. I feel like I have many different information paths I can alternate traveling down, so more random paths don't help me as much anymore. It's like deciding you won't buy anymore books until you finish the ones you have. This is why endless scroll and streaming/unending content is such a massive problem. You get stuck with one thing serving you continual content, and choosing which content to engage in is an essential, maybe THE essential brain process related to individuality and free will.

  <li className="story">
  Jesus's death is double bullshit. He dies for our sins, but his quick rebirth cheapens that sacrifice. Jesus sat in a cave for like 2 days for our sins. They make a big hoopla about the rebirth too, but then he just "ascends to heaven". Like that's some sore loser talk, he died again. Jesus pulled some menorah oil magic with his body at best.
  </li>
  <li className="story">Jesus warned of the coming AI revolution. He warned of a day where god would come to earth and we would all be judged and placed accordingly into heavens and hells. AI and technology could make us immortal through digitization. Immortal and trapped. Jesus having talked to god implies he knows about the nature of the simulation. That the controller of the simulation might sort us as they see fit. Did Jesus just dip on us post-crucifiction? So he didn't die but just left the simulation? Bodhisattvas seem like the real heroes. Buddha and Jesus can be a good example and teacher, but bodhisattvas help those who would be left behind before partaking the highest bliss themselves.</li>
  <li className="story">Once you get a full simulator working, you could start kidnapping people when they go to sleep and wake them up in the simulator, in their room. So you keep adding people who don't know they are in a simulator.
<br/>
The simulator service. They can give people any experience and then plop them back into the world whenever.
<br/>
If someone starts to get visibly suspicious, they just put them back in the real world for a while. The suspicious elements are edited or removed, and they are brought back.
<br/>
Maybe the group has full control over the FBI and CIA: they just give every agent a "secret mission" and show them secrets about aliens and a secret war. After that, growing the network became easy, a little too easy. Someone knows the simulator service team exists, they don't know about the simulators though, they just notice the disappearances and discrepancies in people's stories.
<br/>
Mass paranoia erupts</li>
<li className="story">
  Lights that listen to the music and dance to the beat. For all the ravers. You could program any pattern/algorithm and have the lights match that to the tempo and volume of the beat perfectly. Have you seen an EDM concert at night with all the different lighted things on display? It is beautiful. If all of those different items were relatively synced up via the stage performance, it would be a beautiful and trippy experience. For those people already tripping there, the expression of unity through a visual mantra will promote healthy reflection. I'm hopeful it will also get more people dancing. There seems to be a lot less dancing at festivals post-covid. Like to a degree that must have severe social consequences. When I go to dance, I like to dance around other people who are energized by the music and showing it in their bodies. I soak in some of their radiating energy and imitate some of their moves. But now at these music festivals, I find that I am in the top 1% of dancers. As much as I am proud of my increased hip flexibility, this is a participation award. Participation is low. Give me some dough and togther the world will glow.
</li>
<li className="story">
  Space. Mental space. What do you think about between thoughts? In mindfulness, you are fully taking in the stimuli coming at you from the outside world. You are filling that space with the happenings of the present. It is one of our primary tools for creating mental space, like running water through a coffee maker to clean it. Meditation is different because although your breath is external in that you can feel it on your upper lip, it is tied to your 'default mode network', a brain network active when your focus is inward.
</li>
<li className="story">
Creating space is like getting off a train of thought and instead watching the different trains go by.
</li>
<li className="story">
Language seems unavoidable to me, but I can't tell if that's just a limit of me or not. It's more about adding a new mapping, a new language coordinates system based upon the "frequency" or vibe of a particular brainwave or thought. So you use how something feels compared to other things to create a vector describing it in as many ways as possible. Based on a shared map of nouns, you could compare your brain to another person's and translate your vector to them in a way that includes your full rationale, reduced down to a brainwave or a series of brainwaves that touches the matching parts of the brain with excitory or inhibitory effects so that they temporarily experience the new thought as fully as they can. Telling someone something new already has an endless effect, how much change can experiencing do? It's potentially the best part of psychedelic drugs without all the negatives of a trip, getting to experience a new state of mind with actual control.

Technology shapes us. Technology over time shapes our world. The amount of time with a particular technology shapes how we use future tech. Time travelers could keep the world with slow computers so no single person can wipe out humanity.

<h2>May's Monday Night Review 5/23 (still in progress, I have 1 more day)</h2>
<p>Based on recent experience, I'm going to aim for an end of the Month Review release each month for stories. This means my releases will be at the end of the month and not on mondays, but my review process will continue on Mondays, so the name remains. This month, my content is how to meditate, some notes for The Half-Blood King's Unspeakable Appendix (workshopping the name), and random notes from the past month or so. This month I have been getting my daily tasks done at a high rate and it has eaten into my free writing time. As I become more deliberate, I will edit more. Also I apologize for not updating this page to be more readable, it is on the to-do list.</p>


<h5>How to Meditate: All advice I can come up with ordered by simplicity first. I will be updating this note as I learn more.</h5>
<div className="story">
  <p>Short Form: Breathe in and out through your nose, count your breaths to 5. Focus on the sensations of your breath (particularly the upper lip under your nostrils). As your mind wanders to thoughts that pop up, accept the thought, bring your attention back to your breath and start counting again. 5 minutes a day, every day.
  </p>
  <p>The main goal here is to exercise your focus in this particular way. 5 minutes/day every day, you sit and maintain focus on your breath. You have a general awareness of all your stimuli combined, and you have a focus like the eye of Sauron, it can look at anything but can only look at one thing at a time. In breath meditation, you are training your eye. When thoughts and new stimuli come at you, you should acknowledge where they came from, accept them for being thoughts through the use of any CBT tools, and bring your focus back to your breath.
  </p>
  <p>Brain scans of people before and after meditating for 5 minutes a day for 2 months show growth in the prefrontal cortex, and changes inside the amygdala (reduces fear) and hippocampus (increases cortical thickness). I focus on the prefrontal cortex, where our executive functions and arguably our consciousnesses/we live. This is where our decision-making, awareness, empathy and concentration live. Focusing on your breath directly strengthens the part of your brain in charge of focus. It builds on itself naturally. So build up to a 5 minutes a day practice. Start at 1 or 2 minutes if that is what you can do now, but make it a daily goal. Attach it to a morning routine, and if you miss it, leave a reminder somewhere in your bedtime routine to do a minute before you go to bed. This is like cardio exercise for your heart, except it is 5 minutes instead of 20-30 and all you need to do is sit without listening to or watching any entertainment. If you get extra distracted, then bringing your focus back is like lifting an extra heavy weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The secret main goal of meditation? Building awareness. By awareness I mean observation without judgement. Concentration/focus is a building block that lets us build wisdom/insight. There isn't an english word for this, but the wisdom I am describing is from some Buddha suttra, it is wisdom in action. Awareness is letting the stimuli and thoughts in your brain flow, you notice what is happening around you. You may notice judgements and labels come up, but as they do you deconstruct them and distance yourself. The Buddha's special 4 noble truths technique basically: know the problem, understand the cause of the problem, know the solution to the problem, understand and follow the path towards the solution to the problem. During meditation, sometimes the solution might be that you stop meditating and go do something else, or make a note to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
    Distractions are not detractions. The Buddha would send his disciples into the forest to go learn on their own, to meditate beneath the trees. That is not a quiet environment, modern buildings are actually quite unnatural in that they give us so much silence. So what level of music is okay? It seems like you might be able to do it during some regular chores, I think the focus should be on storylines, hearing media or other people talk occupies your mental space. Pleasant sounds that aren't arranged in story form can serve as a cover for more distracting ones like a loud conversation. The digital and concrete forest we live in today provides so many forms of distractions, and meditation strengthens our ability to control our own minds. So maybe we can make stronger minds now in relation to stronger vices?
  </p>
  <p>Why do this daily:</p>
  <p>Default Mode Network: we have 2 networks, the default mode network and the extrinsic network, the internal and the external. Meditation helps you manage the default mode network better and engage with the external better. Meditation also helps grow the part of the brain associated with executive function and consciousness, aka you. It's like Men in Black with the aliens that lived in human robots. You are the alien in the robot, and meditation is just you exercising. Also your other mindfulness activities are cool and all, but they are not a substitute for meditation. It is like training a particular muscle. Mindfulness activities do not show the same growth in the prefrontal cortex. <a to="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700489">12 weeks or less</a> to make visible changes.</p>
  <p>
    General Explanation: Ideally, you should sit upright with good posture, but do whatever is comfortable. The breath is a powerful tool because it is always there. You are exercising your mind by focusing on it. You can focus on any part of your breath, but in particular I recommend focusing on the air on your upper lip, just under your nose. I like it because it is a subtle stimuli that is always there, but when you focus on it you can notice the sensation. The idea is to focus on the breath, not control it. The aim is to sit in between awareness and action^*. So you can use any part of your breath as your focus. As you get distracted by your thoughts, recognize it, ask yourself where it probably came from, and accept it for how it is. Maybe you left your cat outside, go let your cat back in! If you think of something that you should be doing, by all means, do that thing and meditate later. You check and maybe your cat is really enjoying the company of a bird. You can set a timer to alert you to check on the cat again. If you suddenly have insight, a solution to a problem at work, a creative vision, a clever bit, take out your phone and note down a few words. Usually 3 or more words is all it takes to stamp down the file location of that particular train of thought within your brain. So that is how to deal with distracting thoughts, my strategy for negative thoughts is to take what is helpful and ditch the rest. It is fine to feel guilty for making a mess and to then clean it up. It is only harmful to feel bad. So if you are meditating and feel a pang of guilt, write a quick note for what you will do in the future to atone for the guilt and then bring your focus back to your breath. But most thoughts are just random spawn of our chaos machines, accept them as something separate from you. You are the executive functioning of your brain, these are thoughts passed to you. You can change policies and write memos, but you can't go down the elevator to lower floors.
  </p>
  <p>
    ^* That's why walking meditation is a thing, it is like the breath but a much more complicated physical system to control. When you focus on your breath, you notice a growing force telling you it is time breathe in or exhale. With your awareness of your breath, you may end up having longer or shorter breaths. Walking has many more variables
  </p>
  <p>
  You have 2 forms of focus, the eye of sauron that focuses on one spot, and your general floodlight awareness of your other senses melding together. Meditation is about finding your focus by using your breath as the target of your eye.
  </p>
  <p>
  Curiosity over judgement. You want to be aware of where your thoughts come from, but when you are curious, you aren't there to label everything that comes up. You are looking for understanding, and you are looking for useful things. When you come across things that are unhelpful, there are many approaches for giving yourself distance from those thoughts, like changing "that annoys me" to "I am having the thought 'that annoys me' in reaction to A because of B and C. I am already taking all actions towards not being annoyed, so I am going to focus elsewhere".
  </p>
  <p>
  Kill Will(fullness). You are a Sims character and you are also the player inputting commands for the character. You are the worst Sims character imaginable, if you were the default playable Sims character, no one would play the game, because you, like most if not all people, refuse to do what is in your best interest on regular if not constant basis. This is because your Willful self is most likely a first class citizen inside your mind. As you strip away your willful privileges, you become a much better character. Being a character can be great too, you greatly reduce decision anxiety and can live life like an adventure planned out for you. Surrender to what is.
  </p>
  <p>
  When I play the piano, I can play with two hands at the same time, but I cannot be in both hands at the same time. I naturally look at my right hand when playing the same thing on both hands and I can feel each hit. Proprioception is the sensing of your body at rest, you can tell if your knees are bent or not without moving your legs. I feel each finger before I strike with it. I can do the same with my left hand, though it takes a little more focus. You can focus on each step as you walk, or you can think of something and not notice the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
  Pet meditation. It's fine to meditate with your pets, they may distract you some, but they are like gongs in a temple.
  </p>
  <p>
  Compassionate attentiveness. You are holding your focus so that you can notice your internal stimuli.
  </p>

  Buddhism has a funny location, it is where you get off the samsara bus. You are suddenly walking, moving yourself and choosing your direction. It is wherever it happens to be

<h5>The Half-Blood King's Unspeakable Appendix</h5>
<div className="story">
  <p>Modern day character number 2: Hermione. So she clearly sees Harry getting information from a superior source. Harry isn't clever enough to fool her, but she is clever enough steal the book when Harry is at Quidditch practice and use her time turner to give her ample opportunity to investigate this book. The book thinks of itself as a self aware narrator of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    "It is quite hard to understand magic, mind you, it is like trying to understand madness. After probing the minds of too many remarkably unremarkable pupils who could only be bothered to get whatever OWL score their parents expected of them, I fell for Hermione instantly. The curiosity and light in her eyes while she read my notes was like Lily but with an ensnared intensity and devotion to knowledge. The Half-Blood Queen, long may she reign."</p>
    <p>
      Other vital character: Tom Riddle. Tom was always different, but never as he seemed. What he actually is, that's truly a mystery now, but it was even so before he was born. That family had a hidden secret, magical experimentation unknown to anyone thanks to laws around taboos. The magical world had no clue telepaths even existed, legilimency was a crude alternative. Tom could see your soul through your eyes. Memories hit him at the speed of light. This aged him considerably. But then he faced the Beast, Dumbledore. DD had never met a telepath like Tom, because none existed. So in that first meeting, that first glance, Tom was lost in the depths of a dark ocean. The other thing to know about Tom is that he has a photographic memory. Tom's brain was designed for his dad to inhabit one day, but Tom's dad also didn't know that Tom was a telepath so Tom killed him. Tom knew everything Dumbledore knew at that moment, and was forever changed. Dumbledore was forever suspicious after feeling the cold of that first glance, but they enjoyed their game. I am not sure which of them still survives, hopefully not both, but in any case the responsibility of the job falls to you. The Beast must be contained, entertained and debrained.

  If I (or anyone) reach my goal and make a simulation, within one is everything. One person can be the god of countless universes capabale of developing their own simulations.

When this happens, it won't be one. There will be different people or groups running them and their battles are ours, like Greek gods.

Actually Greek gods are super creepy from a simulation perspective, they sit in a higher plane with little care for time watching us for amusement, interfering in various forms for fun. people who die can reset for prestige mode, no one really dies but an unbreakable rule keeps anyone from leaving Hades. It all screams simulation.

And if we are in a simulation, how much could you trust history? Like what if the Olympic gods were real, but got bored eventually so they just erased any evidence of theirs existence?

  <h2>Monday Night Review- Story Time</h2>
  <p>The purpose of Monday Night Review is to share the top ideas I heard or came up with recently, to list out interesting notes and to expand on the best. In ideal state, I will be doing this every week or two. I want to practice writing more stories, exploring the concepts deeper. This clashes with my desire to get more ideas out, but I think I need to slow down and become a better writer before I can properly share my ideas on a weekly basis. In this edition, I have 4 stories: fan fiction, conspiracy, philosophy, and more fan fiction with some saucy new notes on Snape's Unspeakable Appendix.</p>

  <h5>The Purple Power Ranger</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>
    Zordon has the team, and the green solo ranger, and has them work together sometimes too.
  </p>
  <p>

    The Purple ranger is given full reign with the alien technology and incorporates it into modern technology. It's like a zordon operating system so he focuses on putting observation bots everywhere, to be used in combination with an artillery system on the moon and in various satellites in orbit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tv show rangers are just Zordon trying to see if humans could do it themselves. Several times the team actually fails and the world is at risk, but the orbital strike comes in right as they fail, causing the classic explosions when a villain is killed. They assume they won though.

  <h5>Scott Foster Conspiracy (Current NBA referee, made 134 phone calls to the only ref caught for gambling, Tim Donaghy)</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>
    The reason Donaghy didn't talk to Scott Foster in front of his gambling partners (Donny shared hookers in the same bed as these men). He was afraid of Scott Foster. Scotty don't fuck around. They were great friends, but Scott makes sure you have every reason to never cross him. Scott has been much more careful than Donny. He slowly expanded his network, only ever opening up after gaining significant leverage. At that point he makes a strong offer, giving you a large chunk of what you make for the Business. All you have to do is make calls to slightly favor a team or a player. Scott Foster is playing the long game, before the recent betting revolution, they only bet on teams. They would roll dice to decide which games to influence, and they would try to make it happen with calls. Thanks to long term view, they could influence only a few plays a game and affect the betting line.
    </p>
    <p>

    But that is pre-gambling revolution. Now thanks to prop bets and everything, Scott Foster just runs an algorithm which gives them different bets to influence so they can operate without any visible traces. The refs are given prop bets that they choose from. They need to be randomized, but they can still choose favorites within that, the high volume of sports betting makes that easier for them. They only need to win more than they lose. Scott Foster used the NBA's coverup of the gambling problem as his in. Scott Foster is the NBA now, this is his game. He gets his cut from every game, and has blackmailed and wooed his way into firm control over his boss, ensuring he and his silent partners keep the operation running smoothly.

  <h5>The B-side of Buddha</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>

This is my book name, dibs (the wayback machine will record this dibs eternally, storing it until humanity perishes so respect it)
</p>
<p>
The Buddha left 2 instructions, the first is his direct teachings for the masses. He discovered a path towards enlightenment that worked when he tested it with his students.
</p>
<p>
The second is for people who seek their own path in the way the Buddha did. It's a somewhat obvious gap when you think about it, he teaches the path but doesn't teach finding your own path, even though the Buddha himself found enlightenment without similar guidance. The Buddha teaching about finding your own path openly would hurt his primary cause and confuse his students, he wants to share his path. The Buddha's life mission is to improve the world by teaching his path to everyone. But we are talking about the Buddha, he didn't let that stop him from trying to teach everyone.
</p>
<p>
  That is why I believe the Buddha used reincarnation. Someone finding their own path is continually experiencing death and rebirth as they grow. They leave their past selves behind. Every night when you go to sleep, you brain is edited. You as a live process dies. When you reboot, you are running on a brain that has been slightly updated since you last used it. As many have learned in the past decade, updates can cause problems too. Good Karma is Good Code. When you are nice to people, practice gratitude, and engage in positive self talk, you build a brain that is kinder, more thankful, and encourages you. Buddha Bud tells us that one of the ways karma reflects back on us is in the physical world. When you are nice to someone, they are nice back. This can be true for several reasons.
</p>
  <p>
  But Bud also goes on to say that good deeds today will also affect your Karma for future lives. This is where I think a lot of western readers turn off, when in reality it is actually where it gets particularly exciting for westerners. We don't believe in reincarnation. It seems like the Jesus resurrection bullshit, a tacky story added to the history of good person to make them more holy in remembrance. (As an aside, Jesus 'returned from the dead' only to 'ascend to heaven'? Where did he go while he was dead? Why does everyone pretend he beat death? He sounds more like a greek mythology character that 'escaped' Hades with a really long chain still attached). The Buddha never gave some definitive evidence that he had past lives or proof of future lives. I believe this is key, Bud seems hella practical. He used existing ideas of Karma to get people to care more about being kind and dutiful in this life, even if you didn't like this life you could work towards the next. He wasn't trying to fix his whole society at once, but he was trying to provide help to everyone in the society.
  </p>
  <p>
  So the Buddha included reincarnation, but I believe he was able to speak to both audiences by talking about consciousness in its base components. We are trains of thought and the mechanisms for navigating between those trains and stopping and starting them. As we grow and learn (good karma) or forget and neglect (bad karma), we edit the tracks and connections of our brains. So for major growth, one has to be willing to die to become someone new. If you work hard to be a kind person, you will wake up inside a kinder mind. So if you see something about reincarnation, consider it within the context of neuroscience and neuroplasticity.

  <h5>The Half-Blood Prince's Unspeakable Appendix (maybe the author of this story is the book?)</h5>
  <div className="story">
  <p>

So James and his friends learn how to transform into animals. This was a fairly remarkable feat for a Hogwarts student, especially after the ban on underage magic. Most students didn't have the time, but James and Sirius didn't care much for grades, and the lot of them were animals already. Snape hated them, but he hated being outdone more. So he delves into dark magic in order to perfect transfiguration. Instead of becoming one animal, Snape learns how to transform himself completely. He focuses on transforming into other humans. He eventually masters the two he secretly observed the most, and he uses this to spend time with Lily as James.
</p>
<p>

Memory charm mastery. I hear Lockheart get a lot of crap for only knowing one spell, but memory charms are the first area of study of nearly every dark lord of the past 3 centuries. It is what allows them to amass enough power to become a dark lord before they are caught as a dark peasant. He doesn't just knock out James, he gives James his own memories so no one figures out the substitution. He gets pretty used to stuffing James in a trunk, making up excuses to disappear so he can live James's life. What's the harm? He's a little shit anyways, this a magical intervention he doesn't deserve.
</p>
<p>
Dumbledore is the only one who notices. DD also has a distaste for the cocky James and has had his fair share of fucked up experiments. Snape actually molds James into a good person through the memory implants and other experiments. DD recognizes Snapes brilliance and recruits him. Because the reality of magic is that Hogwarts is a sham ever since they stopped teaching dark magic.
</p>
<p>

Don't get me confused, DD didn't endorse evil, but magic is magic, and an evil wizard has no limits. They would have no chance if they followed ministry law, Grindelwald would have been the best case scenario. The rest are scrubbed from collective memory, their knowledge would otherwise guarantee mass destruction. So the Headmaster has a secret responsibility to develop students in secret, to find trustworthy talents, to give them dangerous knowledge and to supervise their experiments.
</p>
<p>

Dumbledore gave out some of this knowledge, but Snape is the only one to fully earn his trust. DD leaves behind tips for harry and others, but they only get the real access if Snape and DD die. So when Harry goes to face Voldemort in the forest, the deathly hallows are misdirection. Within Harry's right brain is all of DD and Snapes knowledge, designed to only be available as needed. What really lets Harry win is not some matching phoenix feather, it is magic beyond the knowledge of any living being.
</p>
<p>

Snape gets into Harry's head during their ocxlumency lessons, making it easy. DD does most of his work while Harry is 'recovering' from one of his many disasters. Each time he stays a week longer just for DD to do his work
</p>
<h5>
Scattered Snippets
</h5>
<p>
"DD and Snape are the wealthiest people in the world thanks to abusing arbitrage, maybe they have fancy vacations together. Like Snape is a James bond with a country's power behind him, but it's an extremely small operation. Like gringotts doesn't abuse arbitrage just because this group tells them not to, the head goblin is part of the group. Power respects power. So Snape starts small and is always running into DD without knowing it. Like stories of god coming as different people but it's DD.""
</p>
<p>

Dumbledore develops a reincarnation spell, like Buddha immortality. He is Merlin, or was once. Each time he slowly finds memories he hid. Not every lifetime manages to activate the DNA memory though, its epigenetic magic. The Dark Ages had no Merlin, because he was raised with too much violence and too little curiosity.
</p>
<p>

"For this appendix I used a similar magic. I opened for you because you had the requisite epigenetic activation. Don't worry though, I'm the "good" one, that's why DD needs me. He's too damn old, morality has changed a bit since he started. I won't take over your body, I am just using memory for information transfer."
</p>
<p>
"Don't trust DD. Listen to him, do what he says. But never trust. Trust yourself, your instinct, your morality. That is not a man, that is an abomination. I considered keeping my own secrets, but what happens if the Merlin experiment goes rogue? So Welcome to Snape's Secrets. You are now burdened with the care of the most dangerous being ever."
</p>
<p>
"Have you been to the dungeons yet? If you wander long enough looking for darkness, the hallway will end at a wall with 2 unlit torches. Light that with the ameratsu dark flame spell from chapter 12. Salazar's labs lie beyond. Generation after generation of Hogwarts students passed through here without knowing thanks to memory charms. Dumbledore has been building this up for a while. The information disparity compared to Hogwarts libraries is massive. It's as if the knowledge of quantum physics were hidden away. The difference is that the nuclear bomb equivalent in magic could threaten spacetime itself, so I can't blame the guy. No one should know some of the things I know."

  "Plot: MC is trying to beat chatgpt, to upgrade it so they cannot be detected. They find a way to fool all current types of tests, but there is an inherent flaw, the patterns just have a different paradigm. MC is still able to detect their own work, so they consider it a failure at first, they couldn't sell a product as better if it was reliably detectable as well.

Out of curiosity, MC has their trained AI evaluate some current data. The numbers are staggering, how?! How could this many people be using a tech that isn't even publicly known?? The implications: a secret organization of some form is recruiting or taking over in mass. Aliens? Illuminati? At this rate Whoever will have the majority of human communication under control within the week.

How do we stop this? It's a secret war by their choice, we need to go public but how? Their takeover is focused on who is grabbing eyeballs, so most news stations risk exposure and capture. We need to send out a message that has no trace. One which anyone can listen to and confirm the truth of our words. The proof is a better than a signature.

I don't know what we are fighting, but if I can make sure everyone at least knows we are in a fight, then I know someone can do something."

  "Moving in time isn't inherent, we have momentum in time. Thus, we could slow down our time in exchange for massive energy gains. Like with hydrogen fusion and the strong force but our local spacetime is already in motion, so we would have it turn our spacetime turbine like a windmill.

There are 2 main rewards, first is the energy, it could be massive. And second is that we gain access to 2 timelines of influence. We can send out robots to experiment, harvest and build across the galaxy outside of our slowed down bubble. People can choose to come and go as well, so a researcher inside the bubble could make a generational breakthrough and get generations's worth of feedback and additions and corrections. Before a top researchers might have been lucky to see peers or students advance their theories, but the Inside researchers and entertainers see their works as they hold up to successive generations. Most is inevitably trashed, much to the dismay of the Inners. The Inners are basically seen as a mix of revered and reviled gods, reality tv fame hunters, and legitimate reality tv gold. The modest ones often end up with their own cult following and thus fall into the diety type. Most of the Inner world is still a mystery though, as you only hear from whoever chooses to broadcast and that isn't most people.

Endgame is simulations because then you have no time constraints, just energy, limiting your ability to speed up and create more time through that enhanced processing. And because the source is the "field" of time"

  Snape's unspeakable appendix.
  </h5>
  <p>

Snape actually found a spell similar to the horcrux diary but without a piece of soul. This magical intelligence evaluated the reader's morality like the marauders map, sorting hat or room of requirements. If you appear morally good, the book shares all its pro tips and advice. If the book likes you, if it feels friendship towards you, you are given a special offer: "take an unbreakable vow to never share this information and receive my darkest teachings. Otherwise I will erase your memory of this moment and you will go back to thinking there is no appendix."
</p>
<p>
"We lurk in the dark to hunt the Dark."
</p>
<p>
Welcome. This appendix is curiosity explored with guidance of my dark arts code.
</p>
<p>
Knowledge is power. Magic is too mysterious to be calculated in theory, so the newest and most dangerous magic is not discovered by the Dumbledore's of the world. DD has a fatal flaw, he mastered all magic he used, but his code keeps him in the dark. He gained a tremendous amount of power and knowledge by learning from past wizards through cryptic readings hidden within Howarts and whatever secret hoards it holds. But when it came to the big, dangerous stuff like magical fusion reactors, his own research was forced to be theoretical only. No one would let a student do that, so young DD just told his friend Grindelwald this instead, among many other explosive ideas. Convinced DD's ideas must be pursued on a grand scale, GW organizes his war. Either GW takes over and forces people to do them, or DD stops him and gets the clout to make a difference. Say what you will about ole Grindy, he understood humans and strategy far better. Dumbledore is stuck wearing a mask all the time, says I was the first in a while to see through it. He really is brilliant, but he’s far too kind for the dark arts. So I will be his source of knowledge of the dark arts. I will
</p>
<p>
Knowledge comes from everywhere. So we must be everywhere and listen. I found out how the potter prick and his friends sneak around so easily, a tracking map! The tech is insane, there's no way those dumb jocks made it. How can someone lose track of something like that? In any case, I slipped the fat one a potion and took the map off of him, and imperious'ed him into a lovely drinking spree throughout hogsmeade and the girls dormitory of each house, ending in the prefects' bath with an eclectic group of hooligans. Felix Felicis is the first secret potion I will teach you. It's rare because anyone that has a better method keeps it secret, like most high end potions. It's a scary thing to abuse any potion though. So I have been testing it on other students. This is Pig's 3rd time, maybe I should be more careful, but I needed to study that map with an excuse for it to be anyone. Literally anywhere, I had him go out on an apparating trip to pick me up black market materials.
</p>
<p>
But back to the map, knowledge is ours. I've extended the mapping technology, magical computing is being explored with it and we have eyes and ears on any target, anywhere in the world. It seems like magic is creating a quantum link between the map and any region of spacetime. Jormungand, I present to you the World Serpent. we can see and hear anywhere, and can search through everywhere. This is your power to use how you see fit. Your use of this book means you are fundamentally worthy, but know that I am cold blooded, calculated, a bit sadistic. I have no shame, I see what I want to see, I invite you to do the same.
</p>
<p>
No shame does not mean no respect. If you fall in love with a girl, don't use a love potion if she doesn't love you back. Instead, get a time turner, polyjuice potion and some of her hair. Walk into a room, set the materials to the side, note the time and close your eyes. Open them as your crush walks in, fuck them. Then clean yourself up, polyjuice yourself and change clothes, exit the room, time turn, walk in and enjoy the fucking you just delivered. Optionally, you can cast a temporary memory charm and imperius curse on yourself so you think you are the girl and don't remember it. This is beneficial for the time stability side, you won't have to worry about creating a continuous loop because you will just be reacting, you won't be using the knowledge you gained from going back in time. Otherwise you risk fraying spacetime and being vaporized (don't ask how I know). Each time you fuck yourself a new way, you cause yourself to fuck yourself in yet a new way. And you don't know if you succeed, because you go forward with your life while the old version of you that you just fucked needs to do what you just did. Spacetime is having difficulty resolving exactly where you should be amid a potentially infinite parallel threads of spacetime. All of that pressure means you can explode. As for me, I fucked myself as Lily Potter. Carefully at first, but then I tried without the memory charm. I felt the magical resonance of my soul in thousands of timelines simultaneously. I believe I wasn't vaporized because I had faith and leaned into the moment and my feelings. I eventually converged on a stable loop. (Redacted) didn't really trust the process... The memories don't overlap though, it feels like I experienced that night hundreds of times. It is much easier to cheer on James now, I identify with Lily more after wearing her skin and just want the best for her. James is my prize pig now, I've taught him manners and a few tricks.

  A little late at night so speed mode. Here are some notes, with somes notes on top of that.

“I like the idea that all advanced civilizations disappear into the micro world. They find simulations to be a pathway towards immortality and exploration. There is a bit of a time race and then it gets to a point where to exit a simulation level is to leave it for millennia, if you ever do return. So there are “real” people and then there is this massive pool of the would-be dead inside these simulations. The real people have an inherent information advantage, but they lose that quickly as the simulators have years to study for what is days on the outside. The reals anticipate this and put the simulators on guard, wanting to be safe of anyone trying to come out, as unlikely as that may seem.”
</p>
<p>
I like this concept a lot because it gives a good reason for why we don't see advanced civilizations. They are so small that they don't show up on our telescopes, and most of the population is in the sims. It also means that we could be invaded easily by such a civilization, as they would react to us using their time and size advantage to get in unnoticed.

“Carl decides not to rush time travel. He learns from an early visitor when he had his original breakthrough. To keep continuity, Carl decides to not invent it again before the same time. He ignores time travelers and pretends they are crazy“    - Electric Forest-centered time traveler. He keeps coming back to certain places, but because he keeps his cool and sticks to his plan, he doesn't disrupt the timeline. He is super careful. Once he finally does discover time travel though, at the proper time, he has a lot of dope plans. Post-invention Carl doesn't hold back though, he is all over the place and completely unpredictable. So many, many times different Carls past come along to try to subtly give advice, wallow in their own misery, or to battle other time travelers. OG Carl is unfazed, he may be the youngest but he has the latest and best advice to draw from. The character development ends up focusing on the different future’s past Carls and their philosophical differences.

“Space themed show like star trek but it exists at the cellular level. They are the People's Navy, they sail only inside of people mainly. There is much risk turning large again so a race of little people is born.

Our character is new to the mini mission and thinks he will be transformed back. No one told him the odds of surviving were 1/10 and the odds of not having debilitating pain were 0/768 trials so far on record. So when he is captured, he willingly adapts and learns the new life.

MC brings promise of a "cure", a new revival technique his boss was working on. He believed the lies because he thought the corporation would be way ahead of them, not decades behind. MC teaches the concepts to the little people and their tech army finishes the job. The little people gain the ability to transform at will and they have invaded every politically or militarily significant person, maybe even every person. Tracking them is difficult, no one has ever scanned negative, or would if they could make such a scan. The little people seize power instantly, a globally televised event via hacking the visual cortexes of the world. Most of the globe capitulates in the first 30 seconds, we ask if anyone wants to test us, please ask how so that we may limit violent waste. They have the eyes of every key target, anyone who reaches for the proverbial gun explodes into thousands of pieces, destroyed from within. Hesitation is permitted, the rest are engaged in personal debate by the people living inside of them. the operators who have seen everything, more than the people themselves.
</p>
<p>
MC is disillusioned so they give the tech to the other side. This let's them kill and extract the little people inside them. It's like murdering a planet each time in terms of sentient lives lost.
</p>
<p>
MC sees that they are worse and goes back to the little people. They get ahold of the global mini network and learn how to transport people out. They evacuate whole people who are then murdered for the cause.“

scientology fan fiction (basically my psychological thriller but with Shelly as MC)
</p>
<p>
Shelly finds a secret left by Hubbard and escapes down the rabbit hole of this sci fi discovery. I gotta read a scientology summary and make up her story based on that. Like mix in Hubbard's wacky aliens with brainwaves and neural patterns. The idea that if the brain is a computer, someone else could write code in your brain and you would ride those thought paths. But how you react to them is still yours and yours alone. The active thought process is still a complex operation using so many parts together.
</p>
<p>
Shelly achieves what L. Ron only discovered in theory, she programs an alien pattern into her brain and begins to gain an enhanced consciousness which proceeds to solve any problem it is presented with. At first it gives her self defense and she escapes into the night. Then it kept her safe and hidden, isolated in peace. Here Shelly sits with her new brain. She understands how L Ron abused this power to create his cult. Shelly takes the mantle not to destroy Scientology, though she vows to do that as well. She takes it to show that this power could be used for anyone.
</p>
<p>
What does Shelly offer people? A science fiction book that ties in meditation and buddhist techniques for understanding and controlling your brain, with brain tech that helps people control their base brain functionality. Like you could have something that can flash a little light in front of your eye paired with a slim headset that measures brain waves. It lets you turn on “focus/learn” mode when you want to focus alone on a task, you could have others that keep you awake or help regulate your circadian rhythm. It is a central technology in her blockbuster hit. Maybe the alien storyline has snow crash types of more 'archaic' brain hacks, phrasing and language first shaping human thought immensely.”

  <h2>Monday Night Review</h2>
  <p>For about 8 years now, I have been trying to write down any ideas or thoughts I have or encounter that stand out as being better, worth remembering. Or trains of thought that sound promising but you don't have the time to ride them out right now. You can put down a thread and pick it up at any point. Your brain's memory process is not intentional, it generally just does its job without discrimination. You can take agency in your own memory by taking quick notes in your phone* whenever you hear or think of something you find worthwhile. These can be 1-3 words, just enough to trigger your memory.</p>
  <p>
    Monday Night Review is a practice I have been doing occasionally where I will look at recent notes and highlight the standouts, and expand on whatever seems interesting. My current plan is to make a youtube series out of this, and include written notes here as part of that. I have been successfully creating notes continuously, now I want to focus on filtering, expanding and sharing these ideas regularly. This is a way for me to generally work on expression, I am hoping to develop some video editing skills and to improve my communication by condensing and simplifying my logic.

  <h2>Cutting off trains of thought, 2 techniques and some theorizing</h2>
  <p>So blocking out everything and resetting your mind is one of the most powerful tools you can have. When you don't restart your computer it fills up with junk and works slower. So to get back to full capacity, you do your mental reset.
</p>
<p>
Mental reset- listen to music and follow the lyrics. At the same time sing a different song in your head, I often just repeat 'its gone be aaalright!' from Kendrick. On top of that, imagine yourself somewhere you feel very comfortable, maybe it's raining there. You can add smell, feel the humid/crisp air. Once you have it all going, you are clear.** How many layers you need varies
</p>
<p>
**I'm not sure yet on how long is ideal to sit in that state. In the hospital when I felt the most physically depressed on the roller coaster day of them changing my meds, this technique worked instantly for me, it seemed like magic. But I think the female brain can hold more things at once, so they might need to use more layers.***
</p>
<p>
*** What if that causes the bell curve differences for male and female performance. The proposition is that women have a harder time resetting their brain but that means they can stay on task better. They hold more things at once because they keep their trains of thought alive. While men, they are better at being 'dumb', not thinking about anything. We can more easily cut off our trains of thought, which is a tool that can help us come up with new ideas and be mindful, or trap us in the desires of the body, more easily pulled away from focus, impulsive. At the highest level of intelligence though, I suspect that logic matters more than hardware. Women can use techniques like these, men can strengthen their focus. But when we look at the distribution differences, something as small as this could be responsible for the full difference, because this is the foundation of thought. Do you let your brain traversed by continuous trains of thought that occupy most of the time? Or are you continually reacting to the world around you and tying it back other things on your mind as you go? It can be scary to stop a train of thought you like. But if you can put it down and pick it up later from an expected cue or a quick note, your brain will be working in the background and whatever you experience can help you lay new tracks for that train, so it can go down more paths than if it had just raced down the one.
</p>

Mental reset 2- Focusing on your peripheral vision. When you do so, part of your brain happens to turn off, and your inner monologue is turned off. I am still new to this one

  <h2>2023 Update</h2>
  <p>
    In 2022 I focused on improving my habits and designing them around my knowledge of neuroscience and psychology. I started the year targeting 7 daily habits (including this website I'm up to 8). My concept is I want to fill my day up with the things I want to do long term. I am also working on a vice tracking model, but I've been primarily concerned with filling time with positive actions. Here is where they stand:
  </p>
  <p>
    Meditation is my biggest success so far. I had a 10 minute daily practice going at the beginning of the year. At the end of May I bumped it up to 20 minutes. On June 19th, I read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5261734/">a neuroscience study</a> of people who have meditated over 10,000 hours. Their brain scans show unique activity, constant gamma brain wave activity (the fastest type of brain wave), and improvement in areas like empathy, which is supercharged. Basically, Nirvana is real, so since then I've been meditating an hour a day so I can reach Nirvana sometime before 2050.
  </p>
  <p>
    Walking. I was ahead of my goal of 10,000 steps/day until the December cold and the holiday parties left me short. That is a win for me, my goal in walking tracking is to make sure I am hitting a minimum level of activity every day. In 2023, I want to keep up that minimum without caring about the number of steps listed in my phone. I spent too much time caring about it. I want to take at least one walk a day and only check my steps to see if I am below 6,000 for the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reading. I've done a lot here but have far to go. I've been somewhat consistent, I made steady progress on my neuroscience book. For that, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and aim for reading at least 2 pages. I scatter books around my house but still reach for my computer too often. I've begun making it a bedtime routine with some success (only fun books at night). My highlights for the year are the first Wheel of Time book, and Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver (it takes place during the Glorious Revolution and it is oddly accurate, what a weird time).
  </p>
  <p>
    Yoga. I had some strong yoga runs, on the year I think I hit over 50% of days? I'll need my app to calculate that for me. I feel strong here, I am still getting a lot out of my 10-18 minute routine. I'm going gradually deeper into my stretches, so I feel great about where I am at with this one. Daily yoga makes such a massive difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exercise. My performance here has been pretty weak overall, but strong at times. I had some stretches of strong cardio work when it was warm, and I have a jump rope and row machine now to help me in the winter. I'm optimistic about the jump rope, and am slowly getting used to it. At the end of the year I started doing my weighted pullups routine again, I am hoping to actually get into lifting this year. At the end of 2023, I want to be doing 50 pullups with 50 pounds of weight at least once a week. (Currenly I am at 32 pounds and manage 25 with, 25 without).
  </p>
  <p>
    Creative Writing. I've been very consistent with this, any notes I take in my phone count. But I haven't gone deep at all. I have exercises to try out. This year I want to try writing longer things, like screenwriting or longer versions of my sci fi or fan fic ideas. I want to start holding regular rap camps, which will just be some friends coming over for brunch alongside trying out group writing exercises.
  </p>
  <p>
    Music. This has mostly been piano for me, along with some singing and rap practice. I'll do 10-15 minutes of exercies then go through my piano book. After that I love to freestyle, slamming the keys. In 2023 I'm trying out recording myself more often. The inspiration is that when I rap freestyle, there is the desire to write down any banger lines, but that interrupts the flow. So now I occasionally turn on my mic and record the piano as well. It's been weird so far but it's helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working on the Waldgrave. So editing this site mainly. I've been focused on creating content, not showing it. So this year I hope to clean up the site so it can properly host the content I will be publishing. This is by far my least consistent item.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a weekly habit that I have neglected called 'Monday Night Review'. Here I look at all notes of the past week and select the ones that seem interesting. Before I have elaborated on those ideas or shared them with a friend. I am considering doing it as a youtube series and including them here.
