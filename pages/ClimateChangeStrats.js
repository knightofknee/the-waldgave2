      The biggest single issue in my mind is prioritization. We need a global Big Board for climate change, a list of all the top active causes of climate change, and a list of the best available tools to tackle each. Everything is compared and the relatively-easiest wins are progressively attempted until their return on investment drops past the next option. Ideally we would copy the social security model concept and make the board fully interactable so people with other ideas or guesses could see what their choices could lead to.
